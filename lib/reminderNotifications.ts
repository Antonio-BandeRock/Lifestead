// Local reminders: the scheduled doses in Schedules > Meds, the visits in
// Schedules > Appointments, the meals and drinks on the schedule, the work
// planned in Garden > Upcoming Tasks, since 2026-09-16 the bills, upkeep and
// work benefits in Life, and since 2026-09-21 the Days Until counters under
// garden areas, fire as phone notifications, entirely on the device, through expo-notifications (compiled into the 1.0.37.33
// rebuild). Nothing here talks to a server; the content-blind push relay the
// architecture notes describe is a separate, later piece.
//
// Eleven kinds, each with its own switch in Profile > Reminders (see
// lib/reminderPreferences.ts for why drinks default off and the rest default
// on). A kind switched off is dropped before anything is scheduled, so
// turning one off clears what it had already queued at the next reconcile
// rather than leaving a week of stale notifications behind.
//
// TWO SHAPES OF REMINDER, and the difference is the whole of 1.0.39.8.
//
// A TIMED one comes from a schedule_items row, which carries a wall-clock
// time. Doses, appointments, meals, drinks and garden tasks are all of these,
// which is why garden work cost almost nothing to add: it was already a
// schedule_items row and only ever needed a kind.
//
// A DATED one comes from a table in Life that keeps a date and no time at
// all: a bill due on the 5th, a service due six months after it was last
// done, a work allowance that resets with money still in it. There is no
// moment to fire at, so one gets picked (REMINDER_HOUR), and firing on the
// day would be useless anyway, so each kind speaks up a stated number of days
// ahead instead. lib/reminderSchedule.ts holds those lead days and the
// reasoning behind each; lib/reminderSources.ts reads the three tables.
//
// Meals and drinks are one item_type in the schedule and are told apart by
// meal_type, which is why they arrive here in the same query and split into
// two kinds only at buildPlanned. A meal fires at the time it was planned
// for, not ahead of it: the case this was asked for is someone who did not
// notice they had skipped eating, and a nudge an hour early answers a
// different question. An appointment keeps its hour of lead because getting
// there is the part that needs the warning.
//
// NUDGING, the second half of the same request: "a reminder that comes back
// until it is marked done, rather than firing once and being gone. Someone
// who swipes a notification away with their hands full has lost the thought
// entirely, so one-shot is the same as none." Off by default and switched on
// in Profile > Reminders, because for anybody else that is nagging. What it
// does depends on the shape: a timed reminder comes back three times over the
// next hour and a half, and an upkeep item keeps arriving every morning while
// it is overdue. It reaches only the kinds where the app can honestly tell
// the thing was dealt with, which leaves out appointments (nothing marks one
// done), bills (nothing here records that one month of one bill got paid) and
// benefits (used down gradually rather than finished).
//
// How it stays correct without hooking every create/edit/delete path: the
// source tables are the one truth, and syncReminderNotifications()
// reconciles the phone's pending notifications against them. It runs when the
// app starts, every time it returns to the foreground, and after either
// schedule lens finishes loading (every mutation in those lenses ends in a
// reload). A notification exists only while its row still says the thing is
// outstanding, so marking a dose taken, cancelling an appointment,
// deactivating a med, paying off a service or removing a series all drop the
// reminder at the next sync, and the rolling-window series generator in
// lib/db.ts keeps new occurrences flowing in. That is also what stops a
// nudge: marking something done, in the app or from a button on the
// notification, is followed by the reconcile, so the two happen together.
//
// Freshness, per the architecture note that a reminder should say what it
// was based on: every notification body ends with "Schedule as of {time}"
// (or records, routines, check-ins), the moment this sync computed it. That is what the phone
// will show even if the schedule changes while the app is closed, so the
// stamp is the honest part. Background execution is throttled on both
// platforms, so the reconcile only ever runs in the foreground.
//
// Android accuracy: expo-notifications uses an exact alarm when the app may
// schedule them and an inexact one otherwise. The manifest carries
// SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM as of the 1.0.37.41 rebuild, so a phone that allows
// it fires these at the time they were set for. It stays a permission the
// person can withdraw (Alarms & reminders in Android's settings), and some
// Android versions do not grant it by default; the alarm is then inexact and
// a reminder can land a few minutes late while the phone is dozing. Nothing
// here tries to detect which case applies, because a dose reminder a few
// minutes late is still the right reminder.

const IDENTIFIER_PREFIX = 'inside-story-reminder:';
// A snoozed copy is one-off and comes from a button press rather than from
