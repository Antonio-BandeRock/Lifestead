// A minimal stand-in for a DOM-style portal -- React Native has no built-in
// equivalent. Exists because Dropdown.tsx's open menu used to rely on RN's
// own <Modal>, which always renders on its own separate native surface above
// the entire app; a plain in-tree absolutely-positioned View can't do that on
// its own, since almost every screen's content sits inside
// ScreenBackground.tsx's own `overflow: 'hidden'` body -- an in-tree overlay
// mounted deep inside one of those would get clipped at that boundary
// instead of covering the whole screen.
//
// The fix: anything that needs to "escape" (Dropdown's menu) calls
// showOverlay() with its content; the one <OverlayRoot/> that actually
// paints it is mounted at the true app root (app/_layout.tsx), as a sibling
// of <Stack>, so it's never inside any clipped ancestor. Mounted BEFORE
// <AppKeyboard/> there specifically so the keyboard -- rendered later, i.e.
// on top -- always wins any screen-space overlap with an open dropdown's
// backdrop (see AppKeyboard.tsx/Dropdown.tsx's own comments).
//
// Controls (showOverlay/hideOverlay) and content are deliberately two
// separate contexts, not one bundled value -- see
// ActiveInputContext.tsx's own comment for the identical reasoning: a
// producer like Dropdown only ever needs the stable setters, never
// `content` itself, and consuming a value that changes every time it calls
// showOverlay() was a real infinite-render loop (Dropdown re-rendering
// because content changed -> its own effect firing again -> calling
// showOverlay again, forever). Splitting them means Dropdown, which only
// calls useOverlay() for the controls, never re-renders just because
// content changed -- only <OverlayRoot/> (the one actual consumer of
// content) does.

      // guard, added the moment a second real overlay-owning component
      // (CollapsibleOverlayCard) started getting mounted as a PERMANENT
      // sibling of an existing one (AppActionSheet) on the same screen --
      // both call showOverlay/hideOverlay on every render regardless of
      // their own visible/expanded state, "cheap: only one is ever open at
      // a time" per this file's own original design. That assumption held
      // for every real usage before this (Dropdown, PopoverSelect, a
      // standalone AppActionSheet -- always exactly one real owner mounted
      // at once), but with two owners now permanently co-mounted,
      // whichever one's own layout effect happens to run LAST in a given
      // commit -- purely an artifact of JSX sibling order, not anything
      // meaningful -- would silently wipe out the OTHER's real, active
      // content on every single render. A functional update reading the
      // LIVE current slot (never a captured closure value) means a hide
      // call only ever actually clears the slot if it's still the same
      // owner that most recently set it; a later showOverlay() from a
      // DIFFERENT owner already replaced both the owner and the content,

      // no-op instead of clobbering the second owner's real content.
