// What may cross between two people, and which way it travels.
//
// Direct instruction, 2026-09-22, after the device-to-device merge shipped
// in 1.0.49.3: "now that we have that kind of relationship between the user
// devices, we need to program the same thing into the partner relationship,
// the children relationships, and the caregiver relationship. Although I
// know not all of these have all be created, the communication flow as per
// what is being done between the user's devices needs to be the same kind
// of process that happens between partners, and their children, and where
// applicable, their care giver."
//
// THE ONE PLACE THIS DIFFERS FROM TWO DEVICES, AND IT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
// Two devices belonging to one person hold one database between them, so
// lib/snapshotSync.ts works by DENYLIST: everything travels except the few
// rows a device keeps to itself (DEVICE_LOCAL_META_KEYS, DEVICE_LOCAL_TABLES).
// Two people hold two databases, and almost nothing belongs to both of them.
// So this module is the inverse, an ALLOWLIST: nothing crosses unless the
// relationship names it, and a table nobody listed here cannot travel however
// a caller is written. tablesThatCross() is that list, and it is the one
// function in this file worth reading first.
//
// THREE WAYS A PERSON CAN HOLD SOMETHING, and only one of them merges:
//
//   shared          Both people may change it and there is one of it between
//                   them. A household shopping list is the case: either of
//                   you can be the one who goes. This is the situation two
//                   devices are always in, so it takes the same treatment,
//                   a three-way merge record by record with nothing thrown
//                   away (lib/peerMerge.ts).
//   theirs          One person owns it and the other keeps a copy. Their
//                   meal plan, their condition list. Their latest send IS
//                   their current state, so a copy replaces rather than
//                   merges, and a day they took out has to be able to
//                   disappear here too.
//   onTheirBehalf   Somebody may change another person's records for them:
//                   a parent for a child, a caregiver for the adult they
//                   help. Both sides may write, so this merges exactly like
//                   shared, with one difference that has not been built:
//                   the records belong to the other person and must land
//                   somewhere keyed to them, never mixed into the tables
//                   holding this person's health.
//
// WHY THE UNBUILT AREAS ARE WRITTEN DOWN HERE ANYWAY. The instruction says
// plainly that not all of these relationships exist yet. What exists now is
// the communication flow, and it is the same flow for all four roles. An
// area with ready: false is the vocabulary without the plumbing:
// tablesThatCross() returns nothing for it, so no caller can send it by
// accident, and the day it gets somewhere to land the flag flips and the
// rest of this already works.
