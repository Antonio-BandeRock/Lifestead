    title: 'The TSH Target Changes Once Pregnancy Enters the Picture',
    teaser: "The same TSH number that's perfectly fine outside pregnancy can be too high once it starts.",
    summary: "Pregnancy is one of the few situations where the standard testing cadence and targets get a deliberate exception. The biology of Hashimoto's has not changed. A developing baby depends entirely on the parent's thyroid hormone for its brain development during the first trimester, before its thyroid gland is even functional. Authoritative guidance (the American Thyroid Association's 2017 pregnancy-specific guidelines) and clinical review literature both converge on a TSH target below 2.5 mIU/L for anyone already being treated for hypothyroidism who is pregnant or actively trying to conceive, a meaningfully lower ceiling than the standard non-pregnant reference range the Labs & Medication Timing category covers. That's exactly why this is worth planning for rather than discovering after the fact.\n\nA practical step is getting TSH checked and, if needed, adjusted before conceiving, then rechecking it as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, since a levothyroxine dose increase (often needed) takes time to show up as a stable, improved TSH. Not something to wait on until the next already-scheduled annual check the Self Advocacy category would otherwise recommend.",

    teaser: "A separate diagnosis that can look exactly like Hashimoto's starting up, and in over half of cases becomes it.",
    summary:
      "New thyroid symptoms showing up in the months after childbirth get attributed, often correctly, to sleep deprivation and the sheer physical demands of a newborn. But a distinct and surprisingly common condition deserves to be on the list too. Postpartum thyroiditis is inflammation of the thyroid gland triggered specifically by the immune system rebounding after pregnancy's natural immune suppression.\n\nA prospective study of over 4,000 women found it developed in 3.9% of pregnancies overall, rising to 11.1% in women already known to be at higher thyroid risk versus 1.9% in lower-risk women. It typically runs a two-phase course: a thyrotoxic (overactive) phase in the first few months postpartum, often followed by a hypothyroid phase. That same study found 82% of affected women experienced the hypothyroid phase within the first postpartum year. The more important, less-appreciated finding is that this isn't always temporary.\n\n54% of women with postpartum thyroiditis in that same study still had persistent hypothyroidism at the one-year mark, directly challenging the older, more reassuring assumption that most cases fully resolve on their own. The practical takeaway: any new thyroid symptom in the year after childbirth is worth a TSH check specifically, not automatically written off as new-parent exhaustion, and a persistent case can become the same ongoing thyroid management, not a temporary postpartum blip.",

    title: 'Breastfeeding & Levothyroxine: A Reassuring Answer, Not a Reason to Pause Treatment',
    teaser: 'One worry worth putting to rest directly, since stopping thyroid treatment while nursing would be the wrong move.',
    summary:
      "It's an understandable instinct to wonder whether a daily medication is safe to keep taking while breastfeeding. For levothyroxine specifically, the answer is reassuring enough that major medical guidance treats continuing it as the clearly correct choice. The National Institutes of Health's Drugs and Lactation Database states plainly that limited data on replacement-dose levothyroxine during breastfeeding show no adverse effects in infants, and for a biological reason: levothyroxine (T4) is itself a normal, naturally occurring component of human breast milk already.\n\nA treated parent's milk isn't introducing something foreign to a nursing infant's system, just restoring it to a normal level. Thyroid-society guidance goes further, actively recommending that both subclinical and overt hypothyroidism be treated with levothyroxine in women who are nursing. Treatment is the recommended path, not a risk to be weighed against breastfeeding itself. Undertreated hypothyroidism during this period is the actual risk, not the medication used to correct it.",

    title: 'Pregnancy Raises Both Edges of Iodine at Once, Too Little and Too Much',
    teaser: "The Nutrients category already treats iodine as two-edged. Pregnancy raises both edges at once.",
    summary: "The Nutrients & Micronutrients category already makes the case that iodine is a rare exception to \"more is always better.\"\n\nToo little causes thyroid hormone deficiency, but too much can trigger autoimmune thyroid flares in susceptible people. Pregnancy doesn't resolve that tension. It raises the stakes on both sides at once. Research confirms iodine requirements rise substantially during pregnancy and lactation specifically, since a developing baby depends entirely on the parent's iodine intake to build its thyroid hormone supply during the window before its thyroid becomes functional, meaning deficiency during pregnancy carries a higher cost than the same deficiency outside of it.\n\nAt the same time, the same caution against mega-dosing (kelp, high-dose iodine supplements, covered under Problem Foods & Swaps) applies with equal or greater force here, since a sudden iodine surge remains a documented trigger for autoimmune thyroid flares regardless of pregnancy status. This is a reason to discuss iodine intake directly with a doctor once pregnancy is being planned or confirmed, rather than either ignoring it or reaching for a high-dose supplement on the assumption that more can only help during a time the body needs more.",

    teaser: 'Four separate facts in this category all point to the same practical habit.',
    summary: "Every entry in this small category lands on a version of the same point. Pregnancy doesn't put Hashimoto's management on hold. It temporarily changes several of its rules at once, and the biggest risk is treating it like nothing has changed. The TSH target drops (below 2.5 mIU/L rather than the standard non-pregnant range). A common condition, postpartum thyroiditis, can newly appear in the year after childbirth even in someone with no prior thyroid history.\n\nIodine needs rise in a way that raises the stakes of both too little and too much. Breastfeeding is a non-issue for levothyroxine specifically, not a reason to hesitate on treatment. The thread connecting all four: this is a time-limited window where the standard \"check every 6-12 months\" cadence the Self Advocacy category recommends the rest of the time is deliberately too infrequent. Planning ahead, testing proactively, and treating any new postpartum symptom as worth a TSH check are what actually make this window go well.",
