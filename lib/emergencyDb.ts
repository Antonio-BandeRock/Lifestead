// Reading and writing the emergency card.
//
// Added 2026-09-05. Same split every other module here follows: schema in
// lib/db.ts, the assembly and every honesty rule in lib/emergency.ts with no
// database so they can be tested without one, and the reading and writing here.
//
// THE PART WORTH READING BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING.
//
// gatherFromApp() READS what the app already holds rather than asking for it a
// second time. Conditions, active medications with doses, food allergies and the
// person's name are all already recorded elsewhere, and a card that made someone
// retype them would go stale the moment either copy changed. That is the same
// reasoning the Finances area used for grocery prices: read where they already
// live and copy nothing.
//
// The one thing it does NOT read is drug allergies, because there was nothing to
// read. Checked directly: user_food_allergies is the only allergy table in this
// app. A food allergy is not a drug allergy and must never stand in for one.
