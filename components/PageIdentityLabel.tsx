// 2026-07-25: the page title and sub-tab label (e.g. "Insights" / "6
// Dimensions") used to live in ScreenHeader, top of screen, next to the
// help icon. Both moved down here, to the bottom corner OPPOSITE wherever
// the floating hubs (TabHub/LensHub/ScopeHub) sit, specifically so they
// never compete for space with those buttons, without the buttons
// themselves ever being resized to make room.
//
// 2026-07-27: the page title line itself was removed -- LensHub's own
// corner trigger now shows that same page name below its icon (see
// LensHub.tsx's own buttonLabel), which made repeating it here purely
// redundant. `title` is still required, though: it's the only way this
// knows which page it belongs to, needed to look up that page's own
// identity color/icon from TAB_ROUTES (must match a `title` there exactly,
// same contract as LensHub/GatedTabContent's own `pageTitle` prop).
//
// 2026-07-28: also carried GatedTabContent.tsx's own former on-page
// resting prompt ("Tap the [icon] button to select a function"), in a
// real bordered box (border = this page's own tabColor; no fill, so
// whatever's already behind it shows straight through).
//
// 2026-08-08: that resting-prompt text removed entirely -- explicitly
// requested, once LensHub itself started auto-opening on arrival from
// TabHub (see LensHub.tsx's own `autoOpenSignal`): "we won't need to have
// the little box... telling them to Tap the (icon) button to select a
// function," since the popup is already open by the time anyone would
// read it. This component now renders nothing at all (see the early
// `return null` below) until a real lens is actually selected -- the
// "which lens am I in" box (activeLensLabel) is the one job left here,
// and it's unaffected by this change, still shown for every lens on
// every tab as before. The box's own positioning math below is otherwise
// unchanged, still matching the exact same buffers the butterfly artwork
// already keeps elsewhere in the footer:
// - bottom/top edges: exactly the butterfly's own bottom/top edges (same
//   buffer from the system nav bar as the butterfly has below it, same
//   buffer from the footer's iridescent line as the butterfly has above
//   it) -- see boxBottom/boxHeight below.
// - near-butterfly edge: butterfly's own edge on that side, plus that
//   SAME vertical buffer amount again (reused horizontally, not a second
//   separately-tuned gap).
// - far edge (away from the butterfly): SECONDARY_HUB_CARD_LEFT_MARGIN,
//   the same inset every other content box in this app already uses as
//   its own edge margin (see e.g. schedule.tsx/log.tsx's own shared
//   `bodyContent: { padding: 16 }`) -- this box's far edge reaches
//   exactly as far as any of those already do, no further.
//
// Left/right sides swap with the navigation hand, not hardcoded to the right
// -- today (hand: 'left') the hub buttons cluster left of the butterfly
// and this box sits on the right, same as it always has. If that deferred
// handedness toggle (see lib/navigationHand.ts's comment) ever actually
// flips to 'right', the buttons would cluster right of the butterfly
// instead, and this box needs to become a true mirror image on the left
// -- not just re-centered, its near/far edges swap sides too.
// The box's own horizontal span, pulled out 2026-08-30 so the version label can
// sit centred under it without a second copy of this math. Direct request:
// "Move the version number to the lower right under and centered on the box
// that tells the user where they are in the app."
//
// A hook rather than a constant because every input is live: the window width
// and which TabHub icon is currently chosen, since that artwork is wider or
// narrower depending and this box positions itself off its real edge.
//
// TabHub's own button is alignSelf: 'center' with no other horizontal inset in
// play, so it (and whichever icon is centered around it, symmetrically wider on
// both sides) sits centered on windowWidth/2, regardless of the navigation hand --
// only which SIDE the hub buttons cluster on (and which side this box mirrors
// to) depends on that.
//
// On the desktop build the box keeps the width it has at the window's starting
// width and stays against the margin, rather than stretching across however
// wide the window is dragged. Direct request, 2026-09-21: "The You Are Here
// box in the bottom right corner of the footer should not be allowed to grow
// beyond the initial size it is given on install on Windows." The arithmetic
// is pageIdentityBoxSpan in lib/menuFit.ts, so scripts/test_menuFit.js covers
// it; a phone's span is unchanged.

// 2026-09-18, direct: "The lower right corner box that tells you where you

//
// This box is a fixed height by an earlier instruction of its own ("Make sure
// that the box in the lower right corner doesn't grow larger on any tab's
// screen," 2026-09-13), and it is positioned against the TabHub artwork on one
// side and the nav bar below, so there is nowhere for it to grow into. Two
// things could make its text outgrow it, and both are turned off here:
//
//  1. allowFontScaling={false} on both Texts, so the phone's own font-size
//     setting does not apply. This is the app's exception, not its rule (see
//     lib/textSpacing.ts's own "Text that is furniture" section): everything
//     anybody reads scales, and what this box says is said elsewhere in text
//     that does. The name of the tool you are in is under the LensHub button
//     a few pixels away, at a cap rather than a pin, and the resting prompt
//     names a button that is on screen beside it.
//  2. pinnedLineHeight, so the line spacing setting does not apply either.
//     Roomier would otherwise set an 11px line to 20 and fit three lines of
//     the resting prompt where four are needed, which is the same clipping
//     the TabHub menu was reported for the same day.
//
// Not pinned against the desktop's text size, on purpose. Text size on a
// computer is page zoom (desktop/zoom.js), which scales every dp on screen,
// the TabHub artwork included, so a box in plain dp zooms with the artwork
// and stays level with it exactly as on a phone, where the font-size setting
// touches neither. 1.0.42.23 multiplied the box's height, padding, font and
// the version number by a scale of standard zoom over current zoom to hold
// them at the same pixels, which made the box 14% taller than the artwork at
// 110% and shorter at 150%. Reported 2026-09-21: "You made the corner box too
// tall on the Windows version ... Please match how the mobile version is
// done." Undone in 1.0.42.24 with the choice made explicitly: the box follows
// the artwork at every text size, rather than the whole footer being pinned.

// Both states of the box, at the size matched to LensHub's own buttonLabel

// absolutely in the corner with an invisible inline spacer holding its place.

  // At rest on a tab (no tool picked yet) the box carries the prompt

  // place 'Tap the Food button in the corner to pick a tool.' at the top,
  // then it has to go in the black box in the corner." So this box always
  // says where you are: a tool's name once one is open, and until then
  // what to do to get somewhere. A stack screen always passes a label.
  // At rest the tab's own glyph leads the line, 2026-09-13, direct request:
  // "Add the tab icon to each tab's lower right corner black box letting
  // them know to tap the icon for that tab in the corner." The same
  // TabRouteIcon the corner button and the header box draw, so the icon
  // named here is the one to look for. Once a tool is open the box names
  // the tool alone, as before.
  //
  // Same day, on the shape: "Place the icon at the top left, start the
  // 'Tap the (tab name) button...' statement after it on the same row,
  // allowing the sentence to auto-wrap to the next lines using the same
  // white font you used on the screen headers, but make sure the name of
  // each tab is in the color for that tab." So the glyph is INLINE in the
  // sentence (a View inside Text, which React Native lays out on the
  // first line's baseline) rather than a column beside it: text wraps
  // back to the left edge under the icon the way a paragraph wraps under
  // a drop cap, not in a narrower column to its right. The sentence is
  // in the same colors.textSecondary the header box body uses, and the
  // tab name alone is in the tab colour.
  //
  // While a tutorial or Walk me through it is running, the strip at the top
  // already says which button to tap and the ring is round it, so the box
  // stays empty rather than saying it a second time (1.0.68.15).
