// headerShown: false everywhere here -- <ScreenHeader/> below (rendered
// once, as a sibling of <Tabs>, not once per screen -- see that
// component's own 2026-07-27 comment for why) takes its place. The native
// Tabs header used to duplicate that same title, stacking two header bars
// and wasting vertical space, especially in landscape where height is
// already tight.
//
// tabBarStyle: display 'none' -- the old 7-icon bottom bar is replaced by
// TabHub, a single bottom-center floating button that opens a picker for
// all 7 screens. This is a deliberate thumb-ergonomics choice: a
// bottom-center button is equally reachable one-handed regardless of
// which hand holds the phone, where a row of 7 icons forces some of them
// into a stretch for anyone. Swiping (SwipeableTabScreen) still covers the
// fast path between adjacent tabs; TabHub covers jumping anywhere else.
// The underlying Tabs navigator is kept (not swapped for a Stack) so every
// screen keeps behaving exactly as it did -- still mounted in the
// background on switch, still relying on useFocusEffect to refresh data.
//
// 2026-07-26: a single `<ScreenBackground variant="field" />` renders here,
// once, permanently mounted behind everything -- the fix for "the shared
// resting background should be one truly static canvas that never slides,
// resizes, or remounts between tabs." An earlier attempt had each tab's own
// GatedTabContent render its own separate copy of this image, which then
// moved along with that screen's own SwipeableTabScreen drag/slide,
// betraying the "everything else slides on top of a fixed backdrop"
// illusion -- moving it here instead, above/behind <Tabs> and never inside
// any per-screen or animated wrapper, is what actually makes it immovable.
//
// 2026-08-17: the `sky` prop (the animated sun/moon/starfield overlay that
// used to ride on top of this image) is removed -- reported as real,
// confirmed battery drain, see ScreenBackground.tsx's own header note.
//
// 2026-07-27: both the background and <Tabs> now live inside their own
// nested flex:1 View, placed *after* <ScreenHeader/> in normal document
// flow -- not an absolutely-positioned offset computed from
// useScreenHeaderHeight() like this used to be. Flex layout gives that
// wrapper the exact remaining space below the header for free, so the
// background's `cover` crop (and everything <Tabs> renders inside it) is
// automatically confined to the right region without this file needing to
// know the header's own pixel height at all.
// 2026-09-21: on the desktop build (the web target in an Electron
// window) every tab a person had visited stayed drawn under the current
// one, so Food came up over Home's bands with both showing through.
// @react-navigation/bottom-tabs hides an inactive tab through
// react-native-screens, and that library switches itself off on web
// (screensEnabled() answers false there, since it has no native
// screen to hand the work to), at which point bottom-tabs falls back
// to a plain full-size View per tab at zIndex -1, hidden by nothing.
// A phone never sees this: native screens hide the inactive ones. With
// the sceneStyle below transparent by design (the shared background
// lives behind <Tabs>), the fix is to turn screens on for web, which
// makes the library's web Screen give an inactive tab display: none.
// Module level, so it runs before the navigator first renders. The
// root Stack needs nothing: native-stack's web view hides its own
// unfocused routes.
