// Your Story's database side (lib/yourStory.ts holds every decision and
// every sentence). Three jobs: the chosen parts of life, the little Your
// Story remembers about itself, and looking for each item's record.
//
// An item is done when its record exists, so nothing here stores "done".
// Each lookup asks for the EARLIEST record of its kind, which becomes the
// item's dateline, and returns null when there is none. Timestamps come in
// three shapes across these tables (a plain date, SQLite's UTC
// datetime('now'), and ISO or local date-time strings), so every one goes
// through localDayOf rather than being sliced.
