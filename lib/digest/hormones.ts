    teaser: "A nutrient is something eaten. A hormone is something the body itself makes and uses as a signal, and food changes how well that signaling works.",
    summary: "A hormone is a chemical messenger, produced by a gland or tissue, released into the bloodstream, and read by receptors on distant target cells, coordinating everything from blood-sugar regulation to the menstrual cycle to the body's stress response. This is a different kind of thing from a nutrient: a nutrient is raw material the body takes in from outside; a hormone is a signal the body manufactures and sends internally.\n\nFood and lifestyle don't just supply the raw materials hormones are built from (cholesterol for steroid hormones, tyrosine and iodine for thyroid hormone, amino acids for insulin itself), they also directly influence how much of a given hormone gets made, how sensitive the body's tissues are to it, and how quickly it gets cleared, mechanistic connections covered one hormone at a time in the entries below.",

    summary: "Insulin, produced by the pancreas, is the body's primary anabolic hormone, coordinating how cells take up and store glucose, fat, and amino acids after eating. The mechanism is a multi-step cascade, not a simple on/off switch: insulin binds its receptor on a target cell's surface, triggering a signaling chain through insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and an enzyme called PI3-kinase, which ultimately causes GLUT4, a glucose transporter protein, to move to the cell's surface and physically let glucose in, especially in muscle and fat tissue.\n\nThis mechanism is exactly what breaks down in insulin resistance, covered directly in the next entry, and it's the same underlying biology the T2D, PCOS, and MASLD research each independently converges on as their shared central mechanism.",

    summary:
      "Insulin resistance, where target cells stop responding normally to insulin's signal, forcing the pancreas to produce more just to keep glucose in a normal range, is a recurring thread across completely unrelated conditions. Type 2 Diabetes's dedicated research already names it directly as the shared root connecting T2D, PCOS, MASLD, and Chronic Kidney Disease.\n\nPCOS's quantified data (42.6% vs. 17.1% insulin-resistance prevalence) makes it that condition's central mechanism too. MASLD's pathway (fat backing up in the liver specifically because insulin resistance disrupts normal fat metabolism) is the identical underlying disruption. This isn't four separate coincidental findings; it's one shared broken signaling pathway showing up in four different organ systems depending on where the body's compensating mechanisms give out first.",

    summary: "Cortisol is produced by the adrenal glands as the end product of a three-organ signaling relay called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: the hypothalamus signals the pituitary, the pituitary signals the adrenal glands, and the adrenal glands release cortisol, which in a healthy, functioning system then signals back to the hypothalamus and pituitary to turn the whole cascade back down, a self-regulating feedback loop.\n\nCortisol is adaptive in short bursts: it mobilizes glucose for immediate energy and modulates immune activity during an acute stressor. The Lifestyle & Environment research already traces this exact mechanism through four separate, seemingly unrelated everyday topics (alcohol, sleep disruption, high-intensity exercise, and a glucose crash after a sugary drink), all converging on the same HPA-axis pathway, cross-linked directly below rather than repeated here.",

    summary: "Chronic, sustained stress is not simply \"too much cortisol\" as a static fact. Prolonged HPA-axis activation impairs the feedback loop meant to shut cortisol production back down, producing glucocorticoid-receptor resistance and, counterintuitively, a paradoxical pro-inflammatory state even with elevated cortisol circulating.\n\nDocumented downstream consequences span several separate systems: hippocampal atrophy and neuroinflammation in the brain, a well-established contribution to osteoporosis through sustained HPA-axis activation and disrupted bone remodeling, and a shift in immune regulation toward autoimmunity specifically, not just generic \"inflammation.\" This last point connects directly to the broader mission: chronic cortisol dysregulation is a mechanistically-grounded pathway from everyday stress to measurably worse immune-system regulation, not a loosely metaphorical one.",

      "This is a counterintuitive, well-documented finding: in obesity, circulating leptin levels are elevated, not deficient, while ghrelin, the \"start eating\" hormone, runs lower than expected. The problem isn't a leptin shortage; it's leptin resistance, the body's own cells becoming desensitized to a hormone that's chronically present at high levels, through several proposed mechanisms including impaired leptin transport across the blood-brain barrier and receptor desensitization from constant exposure, a similar pattern to how insulin resistance develops from chronically elevated insulin.\n\nThe practical consequence: leptin resistance produces reduced satiety and drives further weight gain, a self-reinforcing cycle that a simple \"eat less\" framing misses entirely, since the body's internal fullness signal has effectively stopped registering correctly.",

    summary: "Lipodystrophy is a group of rare genetic or acquired disorders in which the body cannot store fat normally, either across most of the body or in specific regions. Someone with lipodystrophy typically has very little visible body fat, yet develops severe insulin resistance, dangerously elevated triglycerides, and a fatty liver, the same metabolic complications usually blamed on carrying too much fat. The explanation is that fat tissue has a storage job to do: without a place to safely deposit extra energy, fat instead accumulates in the liver, muscle, and pancreas, where it disrupts those organs directly.\n\nA landmark small trial (9 patients) found that replacing the missing leptin hormone with a recombinant version, metreleptin, dropped average triglycerides by 60% and shrank liver volume by an average of 28% within four months, with several patients able to stop or sharply reduce diabetes medication. The lesson generalizes past this one rare disease: fat tissue, in the right amount and place, is doing necessary metabolic work, not simply adding risk.",

This is the hormone behind the sumo-wrestler segment of NOVA's The Truth About Fat (PBS, 2020): active wrestlers, despite very high total body fat, were reported to carry higher adiponectin than their size alone would predict, illustrating why fat amount and fat function aren't the same measurement, though that specific sumo comparison traces to that documentary and secondary science journalism rather than a dedicated peer-reviewed study, so it stands apart from the well-established general adiponectin science above.",

    summary: "Beyond appetite and reproduction, leptin also directly signals to immune cells: it promotes Th1 and Th17 immune responses (both implicated in autoimmune tissue damage) and suppresses regulatory T cells, the immune cells that normally keep the immune system from attacking the body's own tissue. A 2017 review in a major rheumatology journal traces this mechanism specifically through rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis, the three autoimmune conditions where the leptin-immune connection is most directly studied so far. This is the same regulatory-T-cell mechanism the Hashimoto's research already documents separately, depleted specifically in visceral fat and restorable through a reinfusion experiment (see the linked entry).\n\nThe caveat: this is a mechanistically grounded and active area of research, not yet a settled treatment target, and it is not evidence that body fat itself causes autoimmune disease, only that the hormones fat tissue produces are one input into how active an already-present autoimmune condition runs. This applies across every autoimmune condition tracked in this app, not just the three named above, since Th17/regulatory-T-cell balance is shared underlying immune biology, not a mechanism unique to any single disease.",

Cortisol and the HPA axis is the shared pathway underneath alcohol, sleep disruption, high-intensity exercise, and glucose crashes, each covered as a separate topic in the Lifestyle & Environment research, but all converging here.\n\nLeptin resistance mirrors insulin resistance's \"too much of the signal, not too little\" shape almost exactly. And two hormone systems, thyroid hormones and testosterone, connect directly to the two most extensively built condition categories, Hashimoto's/Graves' and Prostate Health respectively.",
