// The first-launch agreement (X2, 2026-09-29). Before anything else, one
// screen says in plain words what Lifestead is and is not, and the
// person agrees once. The wording lives here, with the number of the
// wording it is: change a point and raise AGREEMENT_VERSION, and everyone
// who agreed to an earlier wording is asked again. What was agreed to is
// one app_meta row (lib/agreementDb.ts) holding the wording number, the
// moment, and the app version it happened in.
//
// Shown by components/FirstLaunchAgreement.tsx over the whole app, and
// readable again from Profile through app/agreement.tsx. Nothing here
// imports React or the database, so scripts/test_agreement.js checks it.

// 2 since 1.0.68.10: the point about locking the app was added.
