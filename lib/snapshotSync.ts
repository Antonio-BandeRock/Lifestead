// Automatic snapshot sync between a phone and a computer, the decisions.
//
// Both devices share one OneDrive folder (see lib/oneDriveFolders.ts), and
// since 1.0.42.28 each keeps an encrypted copy of its whole database there
// and loads the other's when it is newer. This is the whole-snapshot design
// CLAUDE.md decided under "Multi-device sync model": the copy in the folder
// is the current state, a device pulls it, works against it, and pushes it
// back. Step A, which this is, does the saving and loading; step B, the
// session note with Take over now and a 30-minute wait, is
// lib/syncSession.ts (1.0.57.11).
//
// One person, two devices, not meant to be used at the same time, but
// programmed as if they might be. Two guards follow from that, and every
// decision in this file serves one of them:
//
//   1. A save never writes over a copy this device has not loaded. Before
//      saving, the record is read; if the other device saved something
//      newer than what this device is at, the save stops and the person
//      decides.
//   2. A load never throws away unsaved changes on this device. If this
//      device has written since it last saved, an arriving copy is a
//      conflict rather than an automatic load.
//
// What is in the folder: one snapshot file per device, replaced on every
// save, and one small plain record (SYNC_RECORD_FILE_NAME) naming the
// latest snapshot, which device saved it and when. The record holds no
// health content, so a device can see that something arrived without
// downloading or decrypting anything. The device fingerprint in it is the
// same one already visible in the Mailbox file names.
//
// This module does no I/O at all so scripts/test_snapshot_sync.js can check
// every decision without a phone or a folder. lib/snapshotSyncDevice.ts
// does the reading, writing and restoring.

//                        bug this list exists for (1.0.42.30).
//   sync_folder_uri      An Android folder permission. Meaningless anywhere
//                        else.
//   reference_db_version Whether the bundled food database has been
//                        imported into this device's copy. Clearing it
//                        starts a re-import of 160 MB.
