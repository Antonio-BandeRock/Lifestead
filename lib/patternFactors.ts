// Pattern Finder for any factor (F1, 2026-09-26). Until now Pattern Finder
// looked only at food. This turns everything else the app records into
// moments the same comparison can count: check-in tags, sleep, doses marked
// skipped, steps, water, and each tracker the person named (D2).
//
// Pure, apart from the two sibling modules it borrows its arithmetic from,
// so scripts/test_pattern_factors.js checks every figure and sentence here.
//
// The Phase B rules hold for every factor exactly as they do for food:
//
//   1. Each count names its denominator, and the denominator is only the
//      outcomes that had that kind of thing recorded in the window before
//      them. A night with no sleep recorded says nothing about sleep, so it
//      is taken out rather than counted as an ordinary night.
//   2. Each candidate is set beside how often the same thing turns up in
//      any ordinary stretch of the same length that had it recorded
//      (lib/patternBasis.ts), so a tag somebody uses every day does not
//      read as standing out.
//   3. "Shows up before" is the strongest thing any sentence says. Nothing
//      here is called a cause, a trigger or a reason.
//
// A number (sleep hours, steps, water, a tracker) becomes a moment only when
// it falls outside the person's usual range, the middle 80% of their own days
// in the range (lib/yourUsual.ts), so "less than usual" always means less than
// what their days have been, never less than they should be.
//
// Weather and a menstrual cycle are named in the plan too. Neither is
// recorded anywhere in the app yet, so both are said to be missing on
// screen; when either gets a table it becomes one more group here.
