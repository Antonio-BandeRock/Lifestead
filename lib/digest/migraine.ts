    teaser: "The pain is the most visible part. The disease involves the whole nervous system, and a surprising number of people experience it as physical pain from an ordinary touch.",
    summary:
      "Migraine is a common neurological disease, distinct from a tension headache or a symptom of dehydration, involving changes in brain activity, blood vessel function, and nerve signaling, most centrally the trigeminal nerve system and a specific signaling molecule called CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), covered directly in this category's dedicated medication entry. A specific and lesser-known feature: cutaneous allodynia, ordinary touch, brushing hair, or wearing glasses becoming painful during an attack, affects a substantial roughly 65% of migraine sufferers, a physical marker of how far this disease's effects reach beyond head pain alone.\n\nMigraine often progresses through distinct phases: a premonitory phase (mood or energy changes hours before pain starts), sometimes an aura (temporary neurological symptoms like visual disturbances), the headache phase itself, and a postdrome phase (an often-overlooked \"migraine hangover\" afterward). This category covers what's specific to managing migraine: food trigger evidence, supplement and medication options, and self-advocacy around recognizing when a headache needs more than migraine management.",

    teaser: "Chocolate, red wine, and aged cheese top nearly every migraine trigger list. A closer look at the actual evidence behind each one tells a messier story.",
    summary:
      "Food triggers are among the most commonly cited migraine management topics, and research finds a wide range in how often people actually report them, 12% to 60% of patients depending on the specific study, with alcohol, cheese, and chocolate the three most frequently named. The evidence behind each of these three, though, turns out considerably more complicated than most trigger lists suggest.\n\nTyramine, the compound most often blamed for aged-cheese and red-wine triggers, has problems as an explanation: refined modern measurement techniques found Chianti wines, long assumed to be a major tyramine culprit, don't actually contain the levels once believed, and research suggests red wine's migraine-provoking effect may come from a completely different, not-yet-identified compound, not tyramine or alcohol itself.\n\nChocolate's evidence is mixed: it contains only small amounts of tyramine, but amounts of dopamine and serotonin, compounds more plausibly linked to a positive than a negative effect on migraine, even though one controlled study did find chocolate triggered an attack in 42% of tested subjects compared to placebo. The current understanding: food triggers are for many people, but highly individualized, and may only provoke an attack in combination with other triggers (poor sleep, stress, hormonal shifts) rather than acting alone, exactly why a personal tracking approach matters more than following someone else's generic list.",

    summary:
      "Erenumab (Aimovig), approved by the FDA in May 2018, was the first-ever anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody approved specifically for migraine prevention, a major milestone, since it was designed from the ground up around migraine's specific biology rather than repurposed from another condition the way many older migraine medications were. CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a specific signaling molecule released by trigeminal nerve endings and measurably elevated during migraine attacks, erenumab works by blocking the receptor CGRP binds to, directly interrupting this specific mechanism.\n\nThe STRIVE trial (955 patients with episodic migraine) found erenumab reduced migraine days per month by 3.2 to 3.7 (depending on dose), nearly double the 1.8-day reduction seen with placebo, and nearly half of treated patients achieved a 50% or greater reduction in migraine days, compared to about a quarter on placebo, with sustained benefit up to 15 months in follow-up studies.\n\nComparable safety between treatment and placebo groups, with only a modest increase in injection-site reactions and constipation.

    teaser: 'Taking migraine medication too often can create a separate, self-sustaining headache condition, with a specific threshold for how often is too often.',
    summary:
      "Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a formally recognized condition, not a vague caution, occurring when acute headache treatments are used too frequently, specific thresholds exist depending on the medication type: more than 10 days a month for triptans, opioids, or combination analgesics, and more than 15 days a month for simple analgesics like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, sustained for 3 or more months.\n\nThe underlying mechanism mirrors migraine's biology: animal research finds chronic analgesic use drives structural and functional changes in the trigeminal nerve pathway, including upregulation of the same neuropeptides (CGRP among them, covered in this category's dedicated medication entry) involved in migraine pain transmission itself, alongside expanded pain-sensing nerve fields and a lowered pain threshold.\n\nThis creates a self-sustaining cycle: more frequent medication use to manage headaches paradoxically drives more frequent headaches. Specific medication-use frequency, not just whether a treatment \"works\" for an individual attack, is a measurable risk factor worth discussing directly with a doctor, especially for anyone using acute treatment on a regular, frequent basis rather than occasionally.",

    summary: "Menstrual migraine, attacks tied specifically to the menstrual cycle, affects 6% of reproductive-age women in its strictest, most specific form, but research finds over 50% of women with migraine report some connection between their attacks and their cycle more broadly. The leading explanation is the estrogen withdrawal hypothesis: migraine risk rises specifically as estrogen levels fall, not while they're elevated, with specific data from hormonal contraceptive users showing migraine attacks occurring four times more often during the hormone-free days of a cycle.\n\nA caveat, rather than presenting the estrogen-withdrawal explanation as fully settled: a direct review of the evidence found the studies supporting it limited by inconsistent methodology, small sample sizes, and inconsistent case definitions across different studies, concluding the hypothesis, despite being widely accepted, still needs further validation. The PCOS research covers hormonal and insulin-resistance mechanisms in a related, if distinct, context, relevant for anyone managing both migraine and a hormonal condition.",

    summary:
      "Caffeine occupies a two-sided, role in migraine that's worth understanding directly rather than treating as simply good or bad. On one side, standard medical guidance specifically advises people with migraine or other chronic headaches to discuss limiting caffeine intake with their healthcare provider, since it's a documented trigger for some people.\n\nOn the other, well-documented caffeine withdrawal symptoms specifically include headache, alongside drowsiness, irritability, and trouble concentrating, typically resolving within a couple of days once intake stabilizes again, meaning an inconsistent caffeine habit (a lot some days, none on others) can cause headaches through withdrawal even in someone who isn't otherwise caffeine-sensitive at all.\n\nCaffeine is also a common ingredient in combination over-the-counter headache treatments, adding a practical complication: someone using a caffeine-containing headache medication frequently could be managing both a trigger and a withdrawal risk from the same substance, in the same treatment, at the same time. Consistent caffeine intake, whatever the actual daily amount, is often more important for migraine management than the specific total consumed.",

    summary:
      "Most headaches, including migraine itself, are benign, not a sign of anything dangerous underneath. Current medical guidance is direct about the specific situations that call for immediate evaluation rather than assuming a headache is simply a bad migraine: a headache following a blow to the head, a headache accompanied by a stiff neck, fever, confusion, or loss of consciousness, pain specifically in the eye or ear alongside the headache, and any sudden, unusually severe headache unlike anything experienced before.\n\nThis last category deserves direct attention: a headache that reaches its worst intensity within seconds to minutes (sometimes called a thunderclap headache) is different from a typical migraine's more gradual buildup, and guidance is specific that sudden, severe headaches should be reported to a healthcare provider directly, not managed at home with usual migraine treatment. The large majority of headaches, even severe ones, are not emergencies, but knowing these specific, warning signs directly is what actually lets someone tell the difference confidently, rather than either dismissing an emergency or needlessly worrying over an ordinary migraine.",

    summary:
      "Line up everything in this category and migraine reads as a neurological disease deserving more precision than the \"bad headache\" framing it's often given. Food triggers are for many people but more individualized and less clean-cut than popular trigger lists suggest, tyramine's reputation as the culprit behind cheese and red wine doesn't fully hold up under closer, more refined measurement. The magnesium/riboflavin/CoQ10 combination and CGRP inhibitors both represent structured, trial-backed approaches at opposite ends of the intervention spectrum, one an accessible, supplement formula, the other a major, migraine-specific medication class built around the same CGRP mechanism medication-overuse headache also involves.\n\nMenstrual migraine's leading explanation (estrogen withdrawal) is widely accepted, and reported here alongside the gaps still remaining in its evidence base. And caffeine's double role, and the specific red flags that separate an ordinary migraine from something requiring urgency, both matter for the same reason everything else in this category does: managing migraine well depends on specific knowledge, not general assumptions.",

    teaser: 'The official cutoff is 15 headache days a month. Research finds people at 8-14 days just as disabled, an unresolved gap between the formal definition and the lived burden.',
    summary: "Migraine's formal classification (ICHD-3) draws a specific line: chronic migraine means 15 or more headache days a month for over 3 months, with at least 8 of those days showing migraine-specific features; anything below that threshold is classified as episodic. This precise-sounding line has an active controversy behind it: research comparing disability levels found people with 8-14 headache days a month, technically still \"episodic\" by the formal definition, showing disability levels statistically indistinguishable from those meeting the full chronic threshold.\n\nThis has led researchers to propose revised criteria recognizing \"high-frequency episodic migraine\" as its meaningfully burdened category, since the current 15-day line may not actually reflect who needs more aggressive treatment. If headache frequency sits in that disputed 8-14-day range, the formal \"episodic\" label may understate lived burden the CGRP-inhibitor and medication-overuse research covers.",

    summary: "Migraine's reach extends beyond head pain into a documented, independent cardiovascular risk, most pronounced specifically for migraine WITH aura (the visual or sensory disturbance some people experience before an attack). Research in women found active migraine with aura carrying a hazard ratio of 1.93 for major cardiovascular disease, 1.80 for ischemic stroke, and 1.94 for heart attack compared to women without migraine. The striking part: this elevated stroke risk persists even after adjusting for other vascular risk factors, meaning migraine with aura itself, not just the other risk factors that happen to co-occur with it, appears to be an independent marker of systemic vascular vulnerability.\n\nProposed mechanisms include endothelial dysfunction, platelet aggregation, and systemic inflammation. Since migraine affects an enormous global population (roughly 1.16 billion people as of 2021), even a modest per-person risk increase represents a large public-health consideration, and a direct reason cardiovascular risk factors (covered in the dedicated CVD research) deserve extra attention specifically in anyone who experiences migraine with aura.",

For nearly 50 years starting in 1938, the vascular theory, proposed by Graham and Wolff, dominated medical understanding: migraine was believed to result simply from dilation of blood vessels outside the skull.\n\nThe actual breakthrough came from a different direction: sumatriptan, discovered by a team led by Patrick Humphrey and reaching patients in Europe in 1991, was the first drug developed from an experimentally-grounded approach to acute migraine treatment, and its unexpected effectiveness helped drive a shift in understanding, from the late 1980s through the early 2000s, toward migraine as fundamentally a nerve-signaling disorder rather than simply a blood-vessel problem, the modern understanding the CGRP-inhibitor research is built on.",

A prospective diary study found migraine improvement in 47% of women during the first trimester, climbing to 83% by the second, and a striking 87% by the third trimester, meaning roughly 9 in 10 pregnant people with migraine experience improvement by the end of pregnancy. The well-understood mechanism connects directly to the already-established menstrual-migraine research: estrogen levels rise to roughly 30-40 times their normal peak menstrual-cycle level by the third trimester, and, critically, STOP cycling entirely, removing the estrogen-withdrawal trigger the research already names as a major migraine driver.\n\nResearch found this improvement most pronounced specifically in people with a pre-existing history of menstrual migraine, the same population most sensitive to estrogen fluctuation in the first place.

    teaser: 'Migraine with aura roughly doubles ischemic stroke risk on its own, and combined hormonal contraceptives are a named contraindication on top of that, though the evidence behind exactly how much they add is lower-quality than the guideline itself suggests.',
    summary: "Migraine with aura already carries a roughly two-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke on its own, covered in the migraine-and-stroke research, and combined hormonal contraceptives (the pill, patch, or ring containing both estrogen and progestin) are a formally named contraindication specifically for anyone with this type of migraine.\n\nConsensus guidance from the European Headache Federation and European Society of Contraception states plainly that combined hormonal contraception poses an unacceptable health risk in this specific group. The actual quality of evidence behind exactly how much added risk combined contraceptives contribute is low, and much of the historical data behind this guidance comes from the 1960s and 1970s, when oral contraceptives contained far higher estrogen doses than today's ultra-low-dose formulations.\n\nResearch on modern, ultra-low-dose pills (20mcg or less of ethinyl estradiol) suggests they may not meaningfully raise stroke risk in healthy nonsmokers, though this hasn't fully displaced the standing guideline. Progestin-only contraception is the standard, safer alternative recommended for this group, since it isn't tied to the same stroke-risk mechanism. This is a worth-naming-by-name conversation to have with a prescriber for anyone who experiences migraine with aura and is considering or already using a combined hormonal contraceptive, especially alongside any other stroke risk factor like smoking.",

The overlap between anxiety and depression specifically in migraine patients is striking: 42.1 to 84.6 percent of migraine patients with depression also have anxiety, and 66.1 to 85.7 percent of those with anxiety also have depression, evidence these three conditions cluster together far more than chance would predict.\n\nThe relationship is bidirectional, not just co-occurring: longitudinal follow-up research finds baseline anxiety and depression nearly doubling the future risk of developing migraine (risk ratios of 1.8 to 2.2), while an existing headache disorder similarly raises the future risk of developing anxiety or depression (risk ratios of 1.3 to 1.6).\n\nA direct, clinically meaningful consequence: research finds headache frequency and overall impact measurably worse in migraine patients who also have a comorbid psychiatric condition, a practical reason treating the anxiety or depression alongside the migraine itself, not instead of it, matters for how the headaches themselves behave.",

    summary: "Obesity carries a dose-response relationship with whether episodic migraine (fewer than 15 headache days a month) progresses into chronic migraine (15 or more), already a named subject of its dedicated debate elsewhere in the migraine research. Research finds someone with migraine at a healthy weight has roughly a 3% chance of developing chronic migraine within a year, while someone who is overweight faces about three times that risk, and someone with obesity faces about five times that risk.\n\nProposed contributing factors include obstructive sleep apnea (a common complication of obesity, already tied to migraine risk elsewhere in the sleep-apnea research) and the amount of body fat itself appearing to relate directly to migraine's clinical characteristics, not just act as an incidental bystander.\n\nUseful context: obesity is one of several named risk factors for chronic transformation identified in the same body of research, alongside sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, high baseline headache frequency, and medication overuse (covered in the medication-overuse-headache research), meaning weight is a modifiable piece of a larger picture rather than the whole story on its own. This gives someone managing frequent migraine attacks a concrete, evidence-backed reason to treat weight management as part of migraine prevention strategy, not a separate, unrelated health goal.",

    summary: "OnabotulinumtoxinA, the same botulinum toxin known by the brand name Botox, is an FDA-approved, specifically studied preventive treatment for chronic migraine, distinct from the CGRP inhibitors covered in the migraine research. The landmark PREEMPT clinical trial program tested this specific treatment in two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.\n\nPREEMPT 2 found onabotulinumtoxinA statistically significantly superior to placebo for its primary outcome, reduction in headache days per 28-day period (a 9.0-day reduction versus 6.7 days for placebo), with significant improvement on every secondary measure tested too. PREEMPT 1, the companion trial, did NOT find a significant difference on its primary endpoint (headache episodes specifically, a different way of counting than headache days), an inconsistency between the two trials.\n\nThe pooled analysis combining both trials' full data did confirm onabotulinumtoxinA as an effective preventive treatment overall, and research found repeated treatment cycles (administered every 12 weeks) safe and well tolerated over time. This is an FDA-approved, evidence-backed option specifically for CHRONIC migraine (15 or more headache days a month, covered in the episodic-vs-chronic research), not typically used for less frequent episodic migraine, worth discussing directly with a neurologist for anyone whose chronic migraine hasn't responded well to oral preventive medications.",

    summary: "The trigeminovascular system is the specific biological pathway underlying migraine itself, the actual mechanism behind the CGRP inhibitor medications covered elsewhere in the migraine research. Research finds the trigeminal ganglion, a cluster of nerve cells connecting the face and head to the brain, contains a large population of neurons that produce and release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) when activated by physical or chemical triggers.\n\nResearch finds this CGRP release sets off a specific cascade: increased nitric oxide production, sensitization of the trigeminal nerves themselves, and direct interaction with nearby support cells, all of which work together to drive both the pain signal and the blood-vessel changes characteristic of a migraine attack. Useful clinical evidence: research finds CGRP concentrations measurably elevated in blood draining from the head during an actual migraine attack, and research finds these levels normalize again specifically after successful treatment, direct, measurable confirmation that this pathway is active during an attack, not just a laboratory theory.\n\nUnderstanding this mechanism explains why CGRP inhibitors and CGRP-receptor-blocking triptans both work by interrupting this same pathway at different points, and it's a useful piece of context for understanding why migraine is now treated as a neurological-vascular process with an identifiable chemical signal, not a poorly understood \"just a bad headache.\"",

    summary: "Ketogenic and low-carbohydrate diets represent an actively growing area of migraine research, distinct from the food-trigger avoidance covered in the migraine research, this is about a broader dietary PATTERN rather than avoiding specific trigger foods. Research covers several variations, from a strict classic ketogenic diet to a gentler low-glycemic-index diet and the Modified Atkins Diet, all sharing the underlying mechanism of shifting the body's fuel source from glucose toward ketone bodies produced from fat.\n\nNotable: a randomized controlled trial (the EMIKETO trial) found a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet significantly more effective at preventing high-frequency episodic migraine than an equally calorie-reduced, non-ketogenic diet, despite both producing similar weight loss, evidence the ketogenic state itself, not just the weight loss, may be doing independent work. A Mediterranean-ketogenic hybrid diet also showed reductions in both pain frequency and intensity in a pilot study of chronic migraine patients.\n\nResearch finds no clear consensus yet on any single \"anti-migraine\" diet, and it isn't clear whether ketogenic eating is broadly effective for migraine prevention or works best for a specific subset of patients.

GammaCore, a handheld device stimulating the vagus nerve in the neck, has acute-treatment trial evidence too, a sham-controlled trial of 243 patients (PRESTO) found it produced pain freedom in 21.0% of patients at 60 minutes, compared with 10.0% on the sham device.\n\nResearch finds these devices carry a favorable safety profile, with side effects generally infrequent, mild, and temporary, a meaningful difference from medication-based approaches for anyone specifically wanting to avoid drug interactions or side effects, including someone managing multiple conditions and medications already.

    summary:
      "Hormonal transition reshapes migraine, in both directions, and data shows the picture is more mixed than a simple 'menopause makes it better' story. In a study of over 3,600 women, those in perimenopause and menopause were 50 to 60% more likely to report frequent headaches (10 or more days a month), and a separate, 2025 population study of nearly 5,000 women found 46% still had migraine attacks after menopause, with one in five still having attacks past age 60. Once past menopause, when estrogen settles into a new, stable, low baseline, many people do improve, clinic-based data finding 24.4% improved with menopause while 35.7% actually worsened, a roughly even split rather than a guaranteed relief.\n\nThe separate and more urgent point: a headache that starts brand-new after age 50, one that was never a pattern before, always warrants medical evaluation to rule out a vascular, structural, or other systemic cause, rather than being assumed to be ordinary menopause-related migraine. This is especially true for aura symptoms (visual disturbances, numbness, or speech changes) appearing for the very first time in an older woman, since these can closely mimic a transient ischemic attack or seizure. A lifelong migraine pattern shifting around menopause is expected and usually not a red flag on its own, but a new headache pattern starting after 50 is a separate situation that deserves its workup.",

Its burden, measured in disability-adjusted life years (a combined measure of how much a condition actually disrupts someone's functioning, not just how often it happens), is distributed unevenly by region in a way that's informative: the highest age-standardized burden in the world is found in eastern and central sub-Saharan Africa, while Australasia carries the lowest.\n\nThis isn't primarily because migraine occurs more often in one region than another, research on migraine treatment access points instead toward limited access to effective acute and preventive treatment (the triptans, CGRP inhibitors, and other medications) as a major driver of why the same underlying condition produces more lasting disability in lower-resource regions.\n\nRegional trends add another layer: East Asia and Latin America have seen the steepest recent increases in migraine burden, likely tracking lifestyle and diagnostic-awareness changes, while parts of Southeast Asia have seen a decrease. Migraine's global burden is shaped as much by access to effective treatment as by how often the condition itself occurs, a different kind of geographic pattern than the latitude- or genetics-driven variation covered elsewhere.",

Genetic research has identified the actual mechanism behind roughly half of familial cases: a mutation in CACNA1A, a gene encoding a neuronal calcium channel, with two other genes (ATP1A2, SCN1A) accounting for most of the rest. This is confirmed molecular biology, not a hypothesis, published as the classic genetic mapping study in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nPrevalence data confirms this is rare, roughly 0.01 percent of the population, split between families with a clear inherited pattern (familial hemiplegic migraine) and isolated cases with no family history (sporadic hemiplegic migraine).

    summary:
      "The research is overwhelmingly built on adult data, but epidemiological research finds migraine is common in childhood too, with prevalence climbing from roughly 3 percent in younger children to around 20 percent in adolescents, and a separate meta-analysis pooling primary-headache studies finding an overall pediatric migraine prevalence near 11 percent. A subset (0.6 to 1.8 percent of children and adolescents) develops chronic migraine, covered elsewhere in this category as 15 or more headache days a month.\n\nThe complication: controlled trials in pediatric migraine prevention are limited, and research finds the placebo response in children and adolescents is consistently larger than in adults, meaning a reduction in headache frequency often shows up even without active medication, which makes distinguishing an effective preventive drug from a placebo effect harder in this age group specifically.\n\nControlled trial data does exist for propranolol specifically, covered elsewhere in this app as a migraine-prevention medication, with children on it more likely to reach at least a 50 percent reduction in headache frequency than those on placebo, modest evidence in a population where solid trial data is harder to come by.",

      "The episodic-versus-chronic distinction gets direct depth from the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) study, a large, ongoing longitudinal population study specifically built to track this exact transition. Data from AMPP found that of 6,657 participants with episodic migraine in one year, 160 (2.4 percent) had developed chronic migraine by the following year, broadly consistent with population estimates of roughly 2.5 percent transitioning annually. Identified risk factors go well beyond simply having more frequent attacks: depression was found strongly associated with new chronic-migraine onset, alongside allodynia (skin sensitivity during an attack), migraine symptom severity, and medication overuse, covered elsewhere in this category too.\n\nA specific and actionable finding: AMPP data found barbiturate and opiate use independently associated with a higher risk of transformation even after adjusting for other factors, while triptans were not, and NSAIDs showed a more complicated relationship, sometimes protective, sometimes contributing, depending on how often headaches were already occurring. This data gives an actionable early-warning list, depression, allodynia, and specifically which acute medications are being used and how often, worth raising directly with a doctor before chronic migraine sets in, not just after.",

This is large-scale organizational survey data rather than a formal peer-reviewed clinical trial, but the underlying pattern (stigma, disclosure avoidance, emotional cost) is consistently reported across multiple independent surveys, not a one-off finding. This social burden compounds the disability and mental-health research directly: it's a documented barrier, not just an individual, private struggle, since accurate awareness of migraine's severity is itself part of what research finds reduces this stigma's impact.",

    summary:
      "No published trial has tested the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) specifically on migraine. The current literature names that gap, listing migraine, alongside ADHD and autism spectrum conditions, as a neuroinflammatory condition future AIP research should investigate, not one it has already settled.\n\nWhat does exist is controlled trial evidence for the mechanism AIP is built on: removing suspected trigger foods to calm systemic inflammation. A 2025 randomized, sham-controlled trial assigned 98 adults with migraine and a positive food-specific IgG antibody test to either a true elimination diet or a sham diet eliminating different, IgG-negative foods, then measured blood markers at 12 weeks.\n\nThe true-diet group showed a statistically significant drop in IL-6 (down 3.8 pg/mL), TNF-alpha (down 11.4 pg/mL), and CGRP itself (down 9.6 pg/mL, the same neuropeptide behind an actual migraine attack), alongside 1.4 fewer migraine days over the prior 4 weeks and a 10.3-point drop in MIDAS severity scores, all statistically significant; the sham group showed almost no change on any measure. This trial eliminated foods flagged by antibody testing, not AIP's fixed list of grains, legumes, dairy, nightshades, eggs, nuts and seeds, but the shared principle, and the shared drop in a migraine-specific inflammatory signal, is the current evidence base connecting elimination-style eating to measurable change in migraine biology.\n\nA separate 2024 review names the specific pathway most likely responsible: increased intestinal permeability lets inflammatory molecules pass into systemic circulation, where they can directly stimulate the trigeminovascular system, the same nerve pathway. One practical complication to know before starting AIP specifically for migraine: its elimination list includes coffee, and abruptly cutting caffeine is itself a well-documented headache trigger through withdrawal. A difficult first week doesn't necessarily mean the approach isn't working.",

A separate randomized, double-blind trial gave a DAO enzyme supplement, not a dietary change, to 100 DAO-deficient migraine patients for one month and found a reduction in headache burden compared to placebo, evidence the DAO-histamine pathway is a causal contributor for at least some people with migraine, beyond a plain correlation.\n\nThe connection to AIP: the Autoimmune Protocol was never designed around histamine specifically, but its elimination list overlaps substantially with the foods highest in histamine, fermented foods, aged cheese, cured meats, and alcohol among them, several already flagged as migraine triggers elsewhere in this category.

A Cochrane review of acupuncture for preventing episodic migraine pooled fourteen trials covering 1,825 participants for the comparison that counts.\n\nAfter treatment, headache frequency had at least halved in 50% of people receiving acupuncture against 41% receiving sham acupuncture, and at follow-up in 53% against 42%. Put in the terms clinicians use, roughly eleven people need to be treated for one additional person to reach that halving who would not have reached it with sham. Evidence quality was rated moderate. Read carefully, this says three things at once. Acupuncture does more than sham, which earlier versions of this same review could not conclude.\n\nThe margin is small. And a placebo needling procedure got 41% of people to a halved headache frequency, which is a large effect in its own right and says something about how much of migraine burden responds to attention and expectation. Compared against the drugs used for the same purpose, acupuncture came out at least as good, with fewer people dropping out over side effects.

      "Headache is the one place outside back pain where spinal manipulation has been tested against a sham procedure, and the results are instructive about why such a comparison is necessary. A three-armed single-blinded randomized controlled trial compared chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy against a sham manipulation and against usual pharmacological care in migraine, published in the European Journal of Neurology in 2017. Headache frequency improved in the manipulation group. It also improved in the sham group, at all measured time points, while the usual-care control group did not change.\n\nWhen the treatment and its placebo move together and the untreated arm does not, the improvement is being produced by something other than the specific technique: the handling, the ritual, the regular appointments, the expectation. A companion trial in cervicogenic headache, meaning headache generated by structures in the neck rather than by migraine biology, found the same pattern for frequency, with the headache index favoring the manipulation group.\n\nAdverse events across these trials were few, mild, and short-lived. The reasonable reading is that people with headache often feel better under a course of chiropractic care, that the improvement is not clearly coming from the adjustment itself, and that this sits well below acupuncture in the evidence available for migraine specifically. Manipulation of the neck also carries a small risk profile, covered in the Health Literacy safety entry.",
