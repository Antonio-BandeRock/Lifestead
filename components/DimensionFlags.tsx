// Compact, tappable color-coded warning boxes for a single food's own
// 6-Dimension scores -- one box per RED-severity sub-criterion only.
//
// Deliberately shows nothing at all for green ("fine"), unknown ("Not
// Assessed"), AND yellow ("a real but moderate concern"), per an explicit
// product decision 2026-07-31: a food with no serious concern should
// render a visually clean row, so the eye only ever lands on something
// that genuinely needs attention.
//
// Why yellow is excluded, measured against the real database rather than
// assumed: including yellow leaves only 5.9% of the 22,016 foods with a
// clean row (median 2 boxes, max 9), which makes an empty row almost
// meaningless. One sub-criterion dominates that noise -- "Selenium & Zn
// synergy = Inhibiting" alone fires on 11,077 foods, roughly half the
// database, followed by "Sodium = Moderate" and "Saturated Fat =
// Moderate" at ~5,400 each. A warning that appears on half of all foods
// trains people to ignore warnings. Red-only leaves 62% of foods clean
// (median 1 box, max 5) and surfaces the concerns that actually matter
// here: high saturated fat, high sodium, gluten, high sugar, trans fat.
//
// Two accepted tradeoffs, both real information loss, stated plainly:
//   1. An empty row can't be told apart from a food this app has no data
//      for. "Not Assessed" genuinely is not the same claim as "this is
//      fine" (see TIER_DEFINITIONS' own note in
//      lib/sixDimensionsReference.ts). If that matters in real use, the
//      honest fix is a separate "no data" affordance, not recoloring
//      unknowns green.
//   2. Yellow-level concerns are invisible here. They remain available in
//      the food's own full 6-Dimension view, which shows every tier.
//
// Severity/tier vocabulary, the plain-language explanations, the
// actionable prep advice, and the citations are all reused as-is from
// lib/sixDimensionsReference.ts -- this component owns presentation only
// and deliberately introduces no health judgments of its own.
