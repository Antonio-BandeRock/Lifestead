// Your Story guides, 2026-09-24. Direct report, after the first version of
// Your Story listed a few one-line items per section: "It doesn't really
// provide anything like If your interested in, then the way this app works
// for you is... and it then goes on to give you different step by step
// instructions for working with the app, and what each thing will do for
// them." Asked how, the answers were: ordered with no numbers, everything
// for that part of life start to finish, and the full guides on the Your
// Story page with the Home card pointing into the one you are in.
//
// So there is one guide per part of life, plus The Basics that every part
// shares. Each guide opens with how the app works for somebody who cares
// about that part of life, then walks through every piece of the app that
// serves it. Each entry says what to do and where, what it does for you, and
// often what it feeds next.
//
// 1.0.51.8, the same day. Asked whether the guides led anybody to a result
// in the fewest moves, the honest answer was no: they followed the app's
// layout, so a reading lens sat between two setup steps and a chart that
// needs weeks of records sat beside a switch that takes a second. Every
// entry now carries WHEN it belongs (GuideWhen), and a guide reads in five
// groups: what to set up first, what to do every day, what to do when
// something happens, what fills in once there are weeks of records, and
// what is there when somebody wants more. Each guide opens with its first
// result and what it takes to get there. A step two guides share is written
// out once, in the first guide shown, and pointed to from the rest. The Home
// card points only into a first or everyday step, never into depth.
//
// The same request asked for the guides to be written two ways: "The first
// way is for the person who is not autistic or adhd, and the more detailed
// version is for people who are autistic and/or adhd." The choice is a
// plain one, Short or Step by step, asked on the page and changeable any
// time, and never tied to a diagnosis, since whether ADHD and autism become
// selectable profiles is a decision still deferred. Step by step adds, per
// step: how often and how long (cadenceLine, takes), how to get there from
// anywhere in the app (navigationLine, generated from the destination so it
// cannot drift from where the Go there button goes), and the taps once
// there (taps). A tap quotes a button only where the label was read out of
// the screen's source; otherwise it describes the action in plain words.
//
// An entry is ticked the same way a Your Story item is: when its record
// exists. It either IS a Your Story item (item), and is evaluated exactly as
// the item is, so the two can never disagree; or it names a record the
// database layer looks for (record); or it is reading or looking, which has
// no record and never carries a tick.
//
// The writing rules of lib/yourStory.ts hold here too, and
// scripts/test_your_story.js sweeps every sentence below. "Healing Stage"
// appears only as the name of the Insights lens, which is what the screen
// calls it, and "Step by step" only as the name of the choice.
//
// Every destination is a tab and lens key that exists, and every lens name
// the navigation line quotes is one the tab screen shows; the test checks
// both against the tab screens.
