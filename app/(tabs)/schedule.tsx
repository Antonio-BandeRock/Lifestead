// topic. My Meds each need a schedule so there should be a route to do
// that. Both prescriptions and supplements should be considered within
// meds." Before this, Supplements and Prescriptions were two lenses here,
// each carrying its own copy of the form that DEFINES a treatment as well
// as its dose times, and My Meds (a third copy of the definition, with no
// times at all) sat beside them. Now the definition lives in one place,
// Life > My Meds (components/MyMedsSection.tsx), and this lens is only the
// timeline: every active med, its dose times, today's doses to tick off,
// and the interaction checks that depend on those times.
//
// The route in from Life is a Schedule it button on each med there, which
// arrives here as `scheduleTreatmentId` and opens that med's reminder form
// with its group unfolded. The route back is "Add a med" at the top and
// "Edit in My Meds" on each row, both landing on Life with the lens open.
// An OTC drug can be scheduled here like the other two; it never could
// before, and My Meds's own help text used to say so.
