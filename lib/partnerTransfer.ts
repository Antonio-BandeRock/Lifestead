// Actually moving a payload between two phones.
//
// The piece that ties the four halves together, each of which was built and
// tested on its own first: lib/partnerSync.ts decides WHAT travels and honours
// the grants, lib/partnerCrypto.ts seals it so only the recipient can read it,
// lib/syncInbox.ts names and addresses the file, lib/syncInboxStorage.ts puts it
// in the folder. Nothing here re-decides any of that; it sequences it.
//
// WHAT THIS VERSION CARRIES, STATED PLAINLY: condition codes. That is the thing
// originally asked for ("the two sides need to be able to combine the conditions
// for each user into one meal system that both users see"), and it closes the
// whole loop, because lib/partnerPlanning.ts already reads a partner's stored
// codes and plans around both people once they are there.
//
// IT ALSO CARRIES THE MEAL PLAN, as of 2026-09-15. The gap that kept it out was
// never the transport: nothing on the phone could answer which curated recipes
// were on the schedule, because scheduleMealPlanSlot resolved them into saved
// dishes and dropped the pointer. lib/mealPlanSync.ts now keeps that pointer and
// reads it back, so the field the payload format has always had finally has
// something in it. Two weeks forward, and only what is still actually scheduled.
//
// SENDING IS PER RECIPIENT, AND SO IS THE OUTCOME. One partner having no
// encryption key must not stop another partner's file being written, so each one
// gets its own result and the caller reports all of them.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CARRIER THAT ALWAYS WORKS: hand the sealed file over yourself.
//
// Three carriers were investigated before this one, and each was ruled out by
// evidence rather than taste:
//
//  1. A CLOUD API. A OneDrive app registration was completed and then abandoned:
//     Graph's createLink needs full read and write access to somebody's entire
//     OneDrive for a personal account, and /shares requires a bearer token on
//     the reading side too, so BOTH people would have to sign in and both would
//     have to grant access to every document and photo they own. To move a few
//     hundred bytes.
//  2. A SHARED FOLDER. Android's folder picker only lists providers that support
//     directory trees, and few cloud providers do. Confirmed on a real device:
//     OneDrive does not appear in the picker at all. The OneDrive Android app
//     also keeps no locally synced folder to point at instead, unlike the
//     Windows client.
//  3. A QR CODE. Measured, not guessed: condition codes fit easily, a one-week
//     plan is borderline at 141x141 modules, and anything longer will not fit.
//
// So the payload is handed over as a file, through whatever the two people
// already use to send each other things. NO ACCOUNT, NO PERMISSION FROM ANY
// PROVIDER, AND IT WORKS WHEN THEY ARE APART. The tradeoff is honest and named
// on screen: it is a deliberate act rather than a background poll.
//
// BOTH HALVES WERE ALREADY BUILT AND PROVEN IN THIS APP. writeRawIsFile has
// written .is files since recipe sharing shipped, shareFileIfAvailable is the
// second of the two native calls this app has always needed on Android (React
// Native's own Share.share silently discards its url field there), and
// File.pickFileAsync is what Backup & Restore already uses to read a file back
// in. This is wiring, not new capability.
//
// PICKING RATHER THAN TAPPING IS THE POINT. Tapping a received .is file has
// never reliably opened this app on Android, because a content:// URI handed
// over by another app usually carries no filename for the intent filter to match
// (see the 1.0.34.34 finding). Opening the file browser from inside the app
// sidesteps that entirely: no intent filter, no OS registration, nothing outside
// this app has to cooperate.

// THE MAILBOX: link a file once, then stop navigating to it.
//
// Sending through the share sheet and picking a file back works, and needed no
// setup at all, but it asks somebody to steer through their storage every time
// in both directions. That is a file transfer, not a mailbox.
//
// WHAT MAKES THIS POSSIBLE. expo-file-system's picker calls
// takePersistableUriPermission with the read and write flags that were granted
// (FilePickerContract.kt), so a file chosen once stays reachable after the app
// restarts. Pick each side once and every send and check afterwards is direct.
//
// A FILE, NOT A FOLDER, AND THAT IS FORCED RATHER THAN CHOSEN. Verified on a
// real device: Android lists a cloud app in the folder picker only if it
// supports handing over a whole folder, and OneDrive does not, so the folder
// picker cannot see it at all. The file picker can. One file per direction is
// therefore the largest unit available inside somebody's cloud storage.
//
// THE ONE STEP THIS CANNOT DO FOR ANYBODY: creating the shared folder and
// sharing it with the other person. That happens in OneDrive or Drive itself,
// because no app can make a folder in somebody else's storage appear in theirs.
// Said plainly on screen rather than left to be discovered.
