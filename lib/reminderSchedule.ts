// When a reminder speaks, for the things that carry a date rather than a
// time, and when one comes back, 2026-09-16.
//
// Everything lib/reminderNotifications.ts handled until now was a
// schedule_items row with a wall-clock time on it: a dose at 7:45, an
// appointment at 2pm. Bills, upkeep and expiring work benefits are not like
// that. They carry a DATE and nothing else, they live in their own tables in
// Life, and the useful reminder is not "now" but "a while before", because
// the whole point of knowing a bill is due on the 5th is having time to do
// something about it on the 2nd.
//
// So this file answers two questions and holds no data of its own:
//
//   1. Which days does a dated thing speak up on?
//   2. Does it come back after that, and for how long?
//
// It deliberately imports nothing. That is what lets scripts/test_reminder_
// coverage.js load it straight through the TypeScript transpiler and check
// the arithmetic on a PC, the same way scripts/test_home_sections.js checks
// the Home grouping. Reading the tables is lib/reminderSources.ts's job and
// scheduling the notification is lib/reminderNotifications.ts's.

/** Dated reminders fire at 9am local, the hour a day's admin gets looked at.
 *  A date has no time of its own, so one had to be picked; picking it once
 *  here means a bill and a service renewal do not arrive at different hours
 *  for no reason. */

//
// A fifth joined 2026-09-23, a compost pile waiting to be turned. It is
// dated in the same sense the other four are: lib/compost.ts already works
// out the day a pile is next due a turn from when it was last turned, and
// until now that day existed only on the Compost lens, where somebody had
// to go and look at it.
// A sixth joined in Phase 2 (A3): a med whose counted supply is running
// low. The day is worked out from the count, the doses marked taken since
// and the pace on the schedule (lib/medSupply.ts), less the lead the person
// picked, so it is already the day to ask for more and carries no lead of
// its own here.
// H2 (2026-09-28): useBy, something in the kitchen with a use-by date, the
// day before and on the day.
// C10 (2026-09-30): todo, a to-do given a day, on that day only.
// 2026-10-01: cropPrep and cropSow, a crop chosen in My Crops (Garden >
// Sowing Calendar), a week before a sowing window to get the area ready and
// on the day it opens. See lib/cropPlan.ts.

/**
 * How many days ahead of the date each kind speaks up, longest lead first.
 *
 * These are judgment calls, and they differ because the amount of warning

 * days and then the day itself. Upkeep is a job somebody has to book or
 * make time for, so two weeks, then three days, then the day. A work
 * benefit that resets with allowance still sitting in it needs long enough
 * to actually get an appointment, which is the slowest of the three, so a
 * month and then a week; there is no day-of reminder because being told on
 * the day that a physiotherapy allowance resets tonight is not a reminder,
 * it is bad news.
 *
 * A Days Until counter speaks on the day and only on the day, because the
 * day is the whole of what it holds: the person typed "14 days to
 * germination" so that the fourteenth day would be pointed out to them.
 * Nothing needs booking ahead of it, and a counter that lands unnoticed is
 * not a crisis, so there is no lead and no warning.
 *
 * A compost pile is the same shape for a different reason. There is nothing
 * to book ahead of turning a pile and nothing that goes wrong if it happens
 * a day late, so a warning three days out would be noise. It speaks on the
 * day it is due, and unlike a counter it comes back, for which see
 * NUDGES_WHILE_OVERDUE below.

 * renews expires_on) and recording a turn on a compost pile writes a
 * 'turned' event, and in each case that moves the next date, which is how
 * the reconcile knows to stop. Nothing in this app records that one
 * particular month of one particular recurring bill got paid, and a work
 * benefit is used down gradually rather than finished, so for those two
 * "until it is done" has nothing to read. Rather than nagging about
 * something it cannot tell the state of, neither one repeats.
 *
 * A countdown could honestly repeat (Done takes it out of the running list)
 * and deliberately does not: a counter past its day is meant to keep
 * counting on screen so the person can see how far past the mark the plant
 * is running, and that is a thing to look at, not a thing left undone.
