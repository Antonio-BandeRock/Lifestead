// From the garden onto the plate: which of the foods somebody eats came out
// of their own growing, and what that came to.
//
// Phase 6 of the 2026-09-23 cross-app push, and the last of it, because it
// is the only piece in the push that needs capture nobody has done yet. It
// says nothing at all until a garden has fed somebody for a season.
//
// The gap it closes. garden_harvests has carried quantity_remaining since
// the Harvest Log was built, and Food's "From Your Harvest" picker has been
// able to resolve a food from a picking for just as long. What that picker
// never did was take anything off the picking or write down that the food
// went onto a plate, so a bed could feed a household all summer and nothing
// in the app would know. recordHarvestUsage decrements a single number and
// keeps no history, which is the shape markUpkeepDone had before phase 3
// gave it upkeep_doings, so this needs an append-only record beside it
// rather than a second reading of one.
//
// Two rules run through everything here.
//
// 1. Units are never converted across kinds. A price recorded per package
//    says nothing about a kilo, and a count of cucumbers is a count. So an
//    amount comes off a picking only when the meal recorded the same unit
//    that picking is measured in, and where it did not, the row says so out
//    loud and the amount on hand is left alone.
//
// 2. A week or a month nobody logged is a gap, never a zero. Being too busy
//    to log is not a week of eating nothing, so every periodic figure is
//    `number | null`, a blank row says so in words, and the count of blank
//    periods sits under the headline.
//
// Pure: no database, no React, no clock, so scripts/test_plate_source.js can
// check every figure and every sentence without a phone.
