// Saying what the TabHub button is, to someone who has never opened this app.
//
// 2026-09-03, reported through a first-time reader: the button that reaches
// all nine tabs does not look like a button. That is not an accident of the
// artwork, it is deliberate (see TabHub.tsx: "No circle, no fill, no border at
// rest -- the artwork itself is the button"), and it reads beautifully once
// you know what it does. Until then it is a drawing of a seed at the bottom of
// the screen, and every tool in the app is behind it.
//
// The secondary hub already names itself: GatedTabContent renders a resting
// prompt on every tab saying to tap the corner button. The primary one, the
// one that moves you between tabs at all, said nothing anywhere.
//
// The pointer, shown until the button has actually been used, clears itself
// the moment the behaviour is learned rather than sitting there forever being
// ignored. It used to follow a larger welcome card that dimmed the screen;
// that card and its arrow were removed in 1.0.63.17 by direct request, which
// left the pointer as the one thing a new person sees, raised a little and
// written larger and lighter so it reads clearly against its own box.
//
// Deliberately NOT a Modal. A Modal paints above everything including the
// startup overlay (app/_layout.tsx renders DatabaseSetupScreen after the
// Stack), so a hint in a Modal would land on top of the loading screen on a
// cold launch. A plain absolutely-positioned View inside TabHub's own tree is
// covered by that overlay for free, and appears exactly when the app is ready.
