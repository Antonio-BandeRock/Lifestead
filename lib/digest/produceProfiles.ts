//
// A real, genuinely new mechanism ties every entry here to the live
// reference database, per direct request: "If any of them get hidden in

    summary: "Most general nutrition advice treats \"eat more fruits and vegetables\" as a single, universal instruction. It is well-supported advice on average, but it hides a pattern: several of the most commonly recommended foods carry a specific caution for a specific group of people, high-oxalate leafy greens and kidney stone risk, high-vitamin-K leafy greens and blood-thinning medication, raw cruciferous vegetables and thyroid function, high-FODMAP produce and IBS, tree nut allergy.\n\nNone of these cautions are a reason to avoid these foods broadly.

    summary:
      "Sulforaphane isn't sitting in broccoli waiting to be eaten. The plant stores a stable precursor, glucoraphanin, and only converts it into sulforaphane once the tissue is damaged (chewed, cut, or crushed) and a paired enzyme called myrosinase gets the chance to react with it.\n\nA landmark 1997 study from the Brassica Chemoprotection Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, led by Jed Fahey, Yuesheng Zhang, and Paul Talalay, found that three-day-old broccoli and cauliflower sprouts contain ten to one hundred times more glucoraphanin per gram than the corresponding mature plants. The same study fed extracts of those young sprouts to rats exposed to a chemical carcinogen and found a measurable reduction in the incidence, number, and speed of tumor development, tied directly to the same compound.\n\nThe mechanism behind that protection has since been mapped in detail: sulforaphane binds a protein called Keap1, freeing a second protein, Nrf2, to move into the cell's nucleus and switch on a set of genes for Phase 2 detoxification enzymes, the same enzyme family this app's Problem Foods research already names as the target of cooking's goitrogen-reducing effect. Those enzymes speed up how the body clears damaging molecules and reactive oxygen before they can do harm, the mechanism behind sulforaphane's cancer-prevention research.\n\nA 2015 clinical trial from the same Johns Hopkins group tested sulforaphane directly in forty-five moderate asthma patients over two weeks, showing how that mechanism plays out in the body: sixty percent of participants showed a measurable twenty-one percent improvement in a lung-function response to a bronchial trigger, but the response wasn't universal. Twenty percent showed no change, and another twenty percent got worse, a documented reminder that a working biological mechanism doesn't always translate into the same benefit for everyone.",

    title: 'Mustard Powder Sprinkled on Cooked Broccoli Restores Most of What Boiling Took Away',
    teaser: "Cooking deactivates the enzyme cruciferous vegetables need to unlock their sulforaphane. A small, controlled human trial found sprinkling powdered mustard seed onto already-cooked broccoli restored most of that lost activity, more than quadrupling how much sulforaphane the body absorbed.",
    summary:
      "The Problem Foods research covers why cooking cruciferous vegetables cuts their goitrogenic effect: heat deactivates myrosinase, the enzyme that unlocks glucosinolates once a plant's tissue is damaged. The same deactivation cuts both ways, not just a benefit, since myrosinase is also what converts glucoraphanin into sulforaphane, the compound behind most of broccoli's cancer-prevention research. A randomized crossover trial run at the University of Reading tested a direct fix: twelve healthy adults ate 200 grams of cooked broccoli either alone or with 1 gram of powdered brown mustard seed sprinkled on afterward.\n\nMean urinary sulforaphane metabolite excretion was 9.8 ± 5.1 μmol per gram of creatinine with cooked broccoli alone, and 44.7 ± 33.9 μmol per gram of creatinine with the added mustard powder, over four times greater. Mustard seed is itself a rich, unheated source of active myrosinase, and sprinkling it onto food that's already been cooked (rather than mixing it in before boiling, which would just deactivate the added enzyme too) lets it do the same job the vegetable's enzyme would have done raw.\n\nGut bacteria can perform a similar conversion on their own even with no myrosinase added at all, but nowhere near as efficiently: a separate study from the same Johns Hopkins lab behind the original broccoli-sprout discovery found sulforaphane bioavailability from glucoraphanin ran around 10% without active myrosinase present, compared with roughly 35 to 40% when active myrosinase was there to do the conversion directly, a range consistent with what the mustard trial itself found.\n\nJed Fahey, the same researcher behind that Johns Hopkins work, has separately described daikon radish as another myrosinase source worth adding this same way, and one with an advantage of its own: daikon lacks the enzymes broccoli itself carries that can redirect the reaction toward less useful nitrile byproducts instead of sulforaphane. That daikon-specific claim comes from Fahey's stated professional practice, not a separate controlled trial the way the mustard-and-broccoli finding is, worth keeping in mind as a difference in how solidly each is established.",

    teaser: "The same undigested starch that can cause gas early on is what gut bacteria ferment into butyrate, the short-chain fatty acid research finds does the most for the gut lining and for calming inflammation.",
    summary:
      "Chickpeas carry a meaningful amount of resistant starch, the fraction of a food's starch that resists breakdown in the small intestine and reaches the colon largely intact. That's the practical reason chickpeas can cause noticeable gas: the same starch a typical meal would otherwise digest and absorb higher up in the gut instead becomes food for the trillions of bacteria living in the colon. What those bacteria do with it is the point.\n\nFermenting resistant starch is one of the most reliable ways to produce short-chain fatty acids, and butyrate specifically stands out among them, the primary fuel source for the cells lining the colon, and, per a recent narrative review, the most potent of the three main short-chain fatty acids at inhibiting an enzyme (HDAC) tied to calming inflammatory gene activity, directly building on the Treg-induction mechanism this app's Gut & Microbiome research covers.\n\nHow chickpeas are prepared changes how much resistant starch reaches the colon: a controlled trial in 12 healthy adults found cooking chickpea pasta and then cooling it for 24 hours before reheating roughly doubled its resistant starch content, from 1.83 to 3.65 grams per 100 grams, and produced a measurably lower blood sugar response than eating it freshly cooked. A separate randomized trial in 12 healthy adults giving 200 grams of canned chickpeas a day for three weeks found it increased the abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a specific, efficient, well-studied butyrate-producing gut bacterium, while reducing a group of putrefactive and pathogenic bacteria at the same time. And the gas itself does tend to ease.\n\nResearch on a different, well-studied fiber found symptoms peaked in the first few weeks of a higher intake and returned to baseline by the end of a six-week trial, with the degree of that adaptation tied to a person's starting gut bacteria, the same general pattern behind the common advice to increase fiber intake gradually rather than all at once.",

    summary:
      "Almonds are one of the richest common whole-food sources of vitamin E, a fat-soluble antioxidant, alongside monounsaturated fat, fiber, and magnesium content, research consistently links regular tree nut intake, almonds included, to modest improvements in cardiovascular risk markers.\n\nThe one important caution: almonds are a tree nut, and tree nuts collectively are among the small number of foods responsible for the substantial majority of serious food allergic reactions, a different and more severe kind of concern than the other produce cautions (which are mostly dose- or condition-dependent sensitivities, not immune-system allergic reactions). Someone with a known or suspected tree nut allergy should treat this as a separate category of risk from every other produce caution, not a milder version of the same kind of caution.",

      "Most tree nuts carry their fat content mostly as monounsaturated fat, similar to almonds or avocado. Walnuts are an exception: they carry a meaningfully higher share of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid, than nearly any other common nut, part of why walnuts specifically (not tree nuts broadly) show up so often in cardiovascular research on plant-based omega-3 intake.\n\nThe same tree nut allergy caution named for almonds applies here too, walnuts are one of the same small group of foods responsible for the substantial majority of serious food allergic reactions, a separate risk category from the other, dose-dependent produce cautions.",

    title: "Chia Seeds Are a Choking Hazard Eaten Dry, and Whole Seeds Absorb Less Than Ground",
    teaser: "Chia's soluble fiber expands dramatically in liquid, a documented choking hazard when eaten dry, and the same tough outer coat behind that hazard also means whole seeds don't raise blood omega-3 levels the way ground seeds do.",
    summary:
      "Chia seeds carry meaningful fiber (mostly soluble), plant-based ALA omega-3, and calcium content for their size, and their soluble fiber has a distinctive property: it absorbs many times its weight in liquid, forming a gel, which is both the mechanism behind the popular chia pudding texture and a documented safety consideration.\n\nSwallowing dry chia seeds followed immediately by liquid, or swallowing them without adequately chewing or pre-soaking, has documented case reports of the seeds expanding in the esophagus and causing a choking or blockage hazard, the practical, well-established fix is simply soaking chia seeds in liquid for at least several minutes before eating them, which is already how they're used in the Smoothie Builder and similar recipes, not a reason to avoid them.\n\nWhether whole or ground makes an absorption difference has an actual controlled answer: a randomized trial in 62 postmenopausal women gave whole chia, milled (ground) chia, or a placebo seed, 25 grams a day for 10 weeks, and found milled chia significantly raised plasma ALA and EPA, the two omega-3 compounds chia delivers, while the whole-chia group showed no significant change from placebo. A separate, smaller trial giving 25 grams a day of milled chia specifically found plasma ALA climbing 138% above baseline and EPA 30% above baseline within seven weeks, a concrete, quantified sense of how much a milled dose can move blood omega-3 levels.\n\nChia's outer seed coat appears to be the limiting factor: swallowed intact, much of what's packed inside a chia seed likely never gets broken down enough for the body to absorb it, the same reasoning already established for flaxseed. Soaking a whole chia seed until it forms its gel coat softens it, but a blender or spice grinder is the more reliable way to access its omega-3 content, not just its fiber.",

    teaser: 'Whole flaxseed largely passes through the body undigested; grinding it is what unlocks its fiber and omega-3 content.',
    summary:
      "Flaxseed carries substantial ALA omega-3 content and the highest lignan concentration of any common food (lignans are a plant-based phytoestrogen with research behind their potential role in hormone-sensitive conditions), but whole flaxseed's hard outer seed coat means most of it passes through the digestive tract largely intact, unabsorbed, ground flaxseed (or flaxseed meal) is necessary to access its nutrient content, not simply a texture preference.\n\nThe worth-knowing caution: flaxseed naturally contains a low level of cyanogenic glycosides, compounds that can release a small amount of hydrogen cyanide when broken down, but safety-agency assessment found the amount released at normal consumption levels (up to roughly 30 grams of ground flaxseed in a sitting) poses no meaningful risk to adolescents or adults, and heating flaxseed (baking, cooking) further reduces it, a quantified, reassuring answer rather than a reason for concern at ordinary culinary amounts.",
