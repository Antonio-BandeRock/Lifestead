// A Home section as a full-width band: one collapsible row carrying the
// section's name in the colour of the tab it is a window into, expanding
// on tap to the section's real content.
//
// 2026-09-12, direct request, three parts in one:
//
// The look. "You made the left side line be about 4 times thicker than all
// of the rest and then kept the top and bottom lines at about 1 pixel...
// but the right side of the box was left without any line. I like that
// look. Let's try it out on the homescreen first." That is
// InlineSelectList's own grouped-row treatment (a 4px accent bar down the
// left, a hairline below, nothing on the right), lifted onto Home's
// cards. The accent, the hairlines and the header text all carry the
// tab's colour, so the band says which tab it belongs to without a
// separate label, the same signal the old full 2px border carried.
//
// The width. "I don't see a reason to limit the left and right sides of
// screens with the padding... use the available width of the entire
// screen... with the padding in effect for the text or anything else that
// is present, but not for the boxes." So the band itself runs edge to
// edge with no corner radius (a rounded corner on a bar that starts at the
// screen's own edge would curl the accent line for no reason), and only
// what sits inside it is inset.
//
// The fold. "The entities that exist on the Home screen need to collapse
// and expand to one row height with just the name of what it is, such as
// 'Grocery List', and then when they click on it it expands to show the
// rest." The header row is that one row; expanded state is the caller's
// (Home remembers it per section through visual preferences).
//
// 2026-09-12, same day, direct correction: "All things on the Home Screen
// are supposed to be Quick Actions. It makes no sense to suggest that some
// are Quick Actions and others are not." So a band can also be an action
// row: the same one-row shape, but tapping it does the thing (opens the
// scanner, logs a flare) rather than unfolding, and its chevron points
// forward instead of down. There is nothing to unfold for a plain action,
// and a fold that only ever revealed one button would be a step for
// nothing.
//
// Later the same day, two more shapes. A 'static' band is a header row
// with its content always shown and nothing to tap: the Digest cards,
// which the request kept horizontal and "not collapsable" but wanted in
// the same formatting. And an action row can carry a value at its right
// edge (a count), for the two rows that used to be the stat tiles: the
// number is the whole point of those, so it belongs on the row itself
// rather than behind a fold.
//
// Purely presentational: no data, no navigation, so it stays reusable if
// another tab ever wants the same treatment.
