// Real barcode scanning, 2026-08-16 -- follows the exact real, step-by-step
// workflow described directly by the app's own creator: scan the barcode,
// scan the ingredients list, get real nutrient data back from Open Food
// Facts / USDA FoodData Central (see lib/barcodeLookup.ts), build a real,
// quick report with color-coded and read-aloud flags for anything worth
// avoiding (see lib/scannedProductFlags.ts), and -- per direct decision --
// "Buy This" is ONE combined real action: it both saves the product to "My
// Processed Foods" and immediately offers the real price-photo step, with
// OCR attempted on the price too (also per direct decision), always shown
// as an editable, pre-filled confirm rather than trusted silently.
//
// A Food lens since 2026-09-13 (it was app/scan-product.tsx, a Stack
// screen, from 2026-08-16 until then): "only Profile should have screens
// like [that]... All 10 tab related screens should always continue to keep
// their own background or the shared one and not be screens like Profile
// is." So it renders inside Food's own GatedTabContent, on the Food
// background, with the footer band and both hub buttons, and sits in
// Food's corner menu as Scan a Product. Reached from Home's Scan a Product
// row and from a grocery list too, both through Food's openFoodLens param.
// What used to be route params are props; going back is onDone, and the
// grocery list's own return trip is onReturnToGroceryList, which the tab
// decides how to make.

          line up the ingredients and then hit capture. I am seeing no
          capture anywhere." This is a genuine repeat of a bug class this
          whole app has already hit and fixed many times before -- see
          constants/floatingButton.ts's own header comment, which exists
          specifically because "a fixed guess would eventually undershoot
          on some real device and silently hide content behind a [system
          nav bar] again." This screen was the one real place that never
          adopted that established discipline: captureOverlay used a flat,
          hardcoded paddingBottom with no real safe-area-inset awareness at
          all, so on a device using Android's own 3-button navigation (the
          app's own creator's actual, already-documented preference), the
          shutter button was very likely rendering partly or entirely
          behind that real, opaque system nav-bar scrim -- functionally
          invisible, exactly matching "I am seeing no capture anywhere."
          Fixed the same way every other floating bottom control in this
          app already is: add the real, device-measured insets.bottom/
          insets.top on top of the same base numbers, rather than trusting
          a flat guess a second time.
