// devices with little/no bottom safe-area inset. The further `- 4` is a
// second, later, explicit "move it down a few more pixels" request,
// layered on top rather than folded into the clamp above so that history
// stays legible -- this one intentionally allows the final value to go
// slightly negative (the button sitting a few px into what insets.bottom
// marks as unsafe), a small enough amount that it's very unlikely to
// cause real clipping even on a zero-inset device, and worth revisiting
// only if that ever turns out not to hold in practice.
// The further `+ 20`, 2026-07-26: on Android 3-button navigation, that OS
// scrim strip sits exactly at insets.bottom, so the -4 above already put the
// button's own box 4px into it -- and the butterfly artwork itself renders
// ~9px taller than that box (see BUTTERFLY_OVERHANG_Y in TabHub.tsx), so its
// visible bottom tip dipped into the scrim too (confirmed on-device: a
// visible seam behind the artwork specifically in 3-button mode, not
// present in gesture-nav mode where there's no such scrim to dip into).
// +20 clears both with a few px of margin to spare, layered on rather than
// folded into the -4 for the same "keep each request legible" reason as
// that one.
// The further `+ 15`, 2026-07-26: every hub still sat a little too close
// to the bottom footer strip -- explicitly requested a good 10-15px more
// clearance above it. All of them read this same constant, so this one
// change lifts every button together and keeps their bottom edges aligned
// with each other, rather than needing the same delta applied in several
// places.
//
// 2026-07-26, same day: a follow-up briefly moved the BUTTONS themselves
// to float above the footer band entirely (an attempt at "buttons and
// their popup menus both need to move up"), then was explicitly corrected
// -- only the popup MENUS that open from these buttons were ever supposed
// to move that far; the buttons themselves belong right here, inside the
// footer, exactly as this offset already put them. See useMenuCardBottom
// below for the menu-only version of that fix.
//
// The further `- 5`, 2026-07-26: the footer band itself (FOOTER_BAND_HEIGHT
// below, which this offset feeds directly into) was reported too tall --
// explicitly requested to bring the buttons down 5px "along with the top
// of the footer." Reducing this one shared offset does both at once:
// FOOTER_BAND_HEIGHT shrinks by the same 5px (it's derived from this),
// and every button anchored to it (TabHub, LensHub, ScopeHub) moves down
// with it -- and since useMenuCardBottom below is itself derived from
// useFooterBandHeight, every popup menu card moves down the same 5px too,
// satisfying "bring down the menus... by 5 pixels" from the same edit.
//
// The further `- 3`, same day: the footer still read a few px taller than
// intended -- explicitly requested another 3px off the top of the footer,
// with the same "icons and both hub popup textboxes move down with it"
// expectation as the -5 above. Same mechanism, same reasoning, smaller
// amount.
//
// On the desktop the row sits 8 higher. A phone's bottom inset lifts the
// button and the version number under it together, so the number clears the
// TabHub well; a desktop window has no inset, which left the number either
// below the window's edge or, once held inside it, drawn over the well
// (2026-10-12). The 8 is that missing inset, so every hub, menu and footer
// reading this constant moves up together and keeps the phone's spacing.
