## Phase 0. Decisions only the owner can make (10 items)

### P2. A small beta outside the house
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** none
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Five to ten people (two with one of the 19 conditions, two with ADHD, a gardener, a caregiver) for two to four weeks on the Play internal testing track, then a conversation with each. Plus a private, opt-in usage summary the person sends themselves, nothing leaving the phone otherwise. The first named risk says to test logging before building around it. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f2728129b607eae81a0a7b7d

### P3. Redraw the tier table and plan how tiers are checked
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** all
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** One pass over every tab and lens, Free or paid, under the 2026-10-06 rule (Free stays a little useful, paying brings big wins); the Free row predates Life, Garden, Your Story, App Lock, Interests and Learn and leaves the second audience nowhere. Then one module that answers "is this available", read by every gated screen, built early even if it says yes to everything until launch. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f27281e6a3a8f3af4407fc21

### P5. If something happens to me: keeping a life's records reachable
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Life,Profile
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** No forgot-password flow, encrypted backups and App Lock mean a family loses everything on death or incapacity. Design, while the person is well: a recovery key handed to a named person in advance (printed, or sealed to their key through Connections), a sealed letter, and plainly what that person can open. No company server. Build follows in phase 3. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f2728137b703ec99f422084f

### P14. Conversions, a lens of tools people actually need
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Index and rules for P15 to P21: every answer shows the arithmetic and why the measures differ; never across kinds unless the thing supplies the link (a food's density, a substance's molar mass), unknown said as unknown; offline, nothing sent; health conversions never interpret or suggest a dose; answers can be saved into a record; a Convert button beside number fields elsewhere. Decided 2026-10-06: a lens on Life. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f27281d599c9e908f66f60a7

### P28. Safety is never behind a paywall
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** all
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Confirmed 2026-10-06 by direct instruction ("Confirm P28 as written"), and the CLAUDE.md tier table changed with it: the emergency card, med and supplement timing warnings from the interaction rules, allergy cautions and the clinical-claims protections are on every tier including Free. The current tier table puts the rules engine on paid only. Free useful on its own; paying adds depth, people and time saved. The vault (agreed the same day) keeps these outside it as well. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f27281928fe4f7fbfb9ac019

### P34. Separate versions of the app, side by side on one page
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** all
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Asked of you: these meet a standing rule or need a company server
- **How:** Asked 2026-10-12, after the Leaguestead version page: one private clickable page that opens on a version picker (Free, Individual, Partner, a Household seat, a Guardian child, a Caregiver, and the first run with and without a condition), each version kept in its own screens with a bar at the top to come back, each starting from a ready scenario, and each revision numbered. Tony goes through them and lists what has to change, be removed, reworded, updated or added, so what belongs in each version is there and what does not belong is not. Reads its tab and lens lists from lib/paidFeatures.ts and constants/tabs.ts so it cannot drift from the app. Ties to P3 and P27. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f753652f27281c6a5fdc791ae35294f

### U1. The billing floor
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** Noom, Inflow, Goblin.tools, Headway, PictureThis, Paired · **Theme:** What competitors' users complain about (2026-10-09)
- **How:** No free trial that turns into a charge unnoticed: renewal accepted by a box ticked on purpose, a reminder two days before any first or renewing charge, a receipt for every charge, and cancelling in one step inside the app. Decided with P27 before any price ships. Sources: complaints/home.md, across.md, garden.md, companions.md. Decided 2026-10-09: yes.

### U2. Nothing already used moves behind payment
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** Quizlet, Trello, Drafts, Forest, 11pets, Obsidian Sync, Google One · **Theme:** What competitors' users complain about (2026-10-09)
- **How:** A function a person has used on a tier stays on that tier, a price is never raised on the same thing for an existing subscriber, a limit is never enforced by making the person's own records read only, and nothing is priced per animal, hive, deck or project. Decided with the free/paid board and Z15. Sources: complaints/interests.md, home.md, garden.md, across.md. Decided 2026-10-09: no, as written. A paid function turns off when the free trial ends, and the trial is 60 days, long enough for Pattern Finder and Trends to have weeks of records to show. What stays: nothing the person recorded is lost, and the wall says so.

### U3. Say what is Free before setup, and open on the person's own things
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** PictureThis, RHS Grow, Goblin.tools, Veglog · **Theme:** What competitors' users complain about (2026-10-09)
- **How:** No offer screen on opening the app or a tab; what is Free and what is paid is said in the store listing and before the first question of setup, never after it. Sources: complaints/garden.md, home.md. Decided 2026-10-09: yes. Built 1.0.68.5: the Free line sits at the top of the first interview question while it is unanswered and nowhere else (FREE_BEFORE_SETUP in lib/yourStoryInterview.ts); the store listing half waits for the listing.

### U4. Privacy is never what a person pays for
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** Keepsafe, Standard Notes · **Theme:** What competitors' users complain about (2026-10-09)
- **How:** App Lock and the vault sit on Free beside safety (P28), with no ads or trackers on any tier. A placement to confirm on the free/paid board. Source: complaints/across.md. Decided 2026-10-09: yes, x-lock and x-vault pinned to Free on the board.

- **Answers:** Drugs.com · **Theme:** Medication logistics

### A10. Drug-to-drug check through Drugs.com

### A11. Scan your medicine, see its label
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** Drugs.com, Medisafe · **Theme:** Medication logistics
- **How:** Reshaped 2026-09-26 by direct instruction, and shipped the same day (1.0.53.36): the drug-to-drug rule library was dropped for liability. The person scans the NDC barcode on a box or bottle (UPC-A or GS1 DataMatrix), types the code, or searches by name, and the manufacturer's FDA label is shown word for word from openFDA, dated, with its version, maker and a DailyMed link, and a note that a pharmacist can check medicines together. Every screen says what was sent (only the code or the name) and when it was retrieved; a search that finds nothing says so and never shows something else in its place, and nothing opens until the person picks. A label can be kept with a med in My Meds and checked for a newer version (app/medicine-label.tsx, lib/medicineLabel.ts, lib/medicineLabelLookup.ts, lib/medicineLabelDb.ts, scripts/test_medicine_label.js). The app never interprets a label. A lawyer review is advised before store release.

### A11c. Make my own rule from a label sentence
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S-M · **Tabs:** Life,Schedules
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Medication logistics
- **How:** On a label opened through A11, the person picks a sentence and the app opens the personal rule builder with that sentence filled in word for word, the label named with its set id, version and date, and the linked med chosen. The person decides the timing and whether to keep it; the rule is labelled as theirs, never as the app's. Nothing is suggested or reworded by the app. Added 2026-09-26 after the liability discussion.

### A12. Doses taken, said in words
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Trends,Reports

### X2. A first-launch agreement screen
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** all
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Shared foundations
- **How:** Before anything else on a first launch, one screen says in plain words what the app is and is not: general information and the person's own records, not medical advice, not a diagnosis, not a substitute for a doctor or pharmacist, allergen-aware and never allergy-safe, and a reminder to check with a doctor before making medical decisions (which Apple asks of health apps). The person agrees before going on; the date and the version of the wording they agreed to are kept, and a changed wording asks again. Links to the terms of use and privacy policy (X3). Readable again any time from Profile. Added 2026-09-26. Built 1.0.56.22: first-launch screen with six points, agreement kept by wording version in app_meta, asked again when the wording changes, readable from Profile; legal links wait for X3.

### X3. Terms of use and privacy policy
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** all

- **How:** Two plain-language pages on insidestoryapp.com (the Worker inside-story-site, docs/app-links), linked from X2, Profile and the store listings, and required by both stores. The privacy policy says what the local-first design means: health records stay on the device and the person's own cloud folder, no company server holds them, and exactly what the few lookups send (a barcode, a medicine code or name). Covers the FTC health breach rule, GDPR and Mexico's data protection law in outline. Written as drafts for a lawyer to review before store release, never presented as legal advice. Added 2026-09-26. Built 1.0.56.23: terms and privacy pages live on insidestoryapp.com, linked from the agreement, Profile and the home page; contact and governing law left for the legal review.

### P8. A convention for new text, so translation is not a rewrite
- **Ships by:** Reading content · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** all
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Whole sentences, never glued fragments; counts through one plural helper; dates and numbers through one formatter. A small audit script on new files, then a decision on when the i18n library goes in. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f272818cbcd9fc22df82a27f

### P11. Bring CLAUDE.md in line with what is built
- **Ships by:** Reading content · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** none
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Platform scope still says the desktop is a PWA through PWABuilder (it is Electron); the Architecture intro says sync is not implemented (it is); nine tabs will be ten; the Free row is out of date (P3). Archive first, since the file is at the 100 KB limit. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f27281b1ac2fd6ecc12df8f2

### P13. The right measures for where the person lives, everywhere
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** all
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Today lib/measurement.ts picks only metric or imperial by region, and lib/unitConversion.ts has one cup and one pint (US). Add a measures profile from the region, changeable in Profile: US 237 ml, metric 250 ml and Japanese 200 ml cups, the Australian 20 ml tablespoon, UK pints and gallons, stones, gas marks and fan ovens, kJ or kcal and salt or sodium on labels, lab units (P18), date, decimal and clock formats.

### P27. One entitlement gate every feature checks
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** all
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Tiers are not decided yet, so build the mechanism now: one table maps features to tiers and every screen asks one function. Deciding or changing tiers becomes an edit to the table. A gated feature names the tier that includes it through explainNotYet; Developer Tools can switch tiers; store billing feeds it later. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f272812e8721f0bee87e8dc0 Partly built 1.0.65.6 (2026-10-09): lib/paidFeatures.ts holds the 44 paid lenses read off the free/paid board, lib/entitlement.ts holds the tier per device, GatedTabContent draws components/PaidWall.tsx in place of a paid lens on Free, LensHub marks paid lenses with a small key, and Profile > Developer Tools switches Free and Paid; scripts/test_paid_features.js. Still open: paid parts inside a Free screen (For You card, depth report, Make this a rule, From your garden, refill, taper, injection sites, family roster, sync, the Your Life in Squares Home card) and store billing.

### Q2. Any ingredient or additive of your own to avoid
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Food
- **Answers:** Fig · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Fig names 2,800+ restrictions. A free-text avoid list (an ingredient, an additive, an E number, a family such as "anything with carrageenan") matched by the same ingredient reader the scan and the recipe import use, so every lookup, scan, imported recipe and builder flags it with the person's own words as the reason.

### Q3. Import measured against the 50 most visited recipe sites
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Food
- **Answers:** Paprika · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Keep a dated list of the 50 most visited recipe sites and blogs in scripts/, run lib/recipeImport.ts against one page from each in a test, record which import cleanly, and fix every miss. Publish the rate in the plan so it can be compared with Paprika's.

### Q5. Fewer taps to log than MacroFactor
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Food,Home
- **Answers:** MacroFactor · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Count taps for the tasks MacroFactor publishes (one food, a recipe, yesterday's breakfast again, a usual lunch) in a script that walks the screens, write the counts down, then cut ours below theirs: one tap to repeat a recent meal from Home, "same as yesterday", and recents ranked by time of day. Photo recognition stays with Z1, opt-in only.

### Q10. A screen reader audit
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** Every leader · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Text already scales uncapped. Walk every tab with TalkBack and the desktop's narrator, give every icon button an accessibilityLabel, and add a script that fails on a Pressable with no label, so accessibility is a measured win rather than a "not checked" against every leader.

### Q11. Dose reminders that read the meals around them
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Schedules
- **Answers:** Apple Health Medications, MyTherapy, Medisafe · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** The reminder body reads doseMealTiming when it is scheduled and again when a meal is logged: a calcium-rich breakfast logged at 7:40 turns the 8:00 levothyroxine reminder into one naming the breakfast and the later window, with the time the reading was made ("based on food logged as of 7:45"). Falls back to the plain reminder when nothing is logged.

### Q12. Days left that follow the real schedule
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Schedules
- **Answers:** MyTherapy, Medisafe · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Supply runs down by the dose timeline itself (taper steps, every-other-week, weekly, monthly) rather than a daily average, and the refill ask lands on the Today timeline far enough ahead to call the pharmacy, with the pharmacy one tap away (A6).

### Q15. A visual day
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Schedules,Home
- **Answers:** Tiimo, Structured · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** The Today timeline drawn as blocks sized by their minutes, each in its tab colour with its lens icon, the current block counting down, readable at a glance without reading a list; the list stays one tap away.

### Q18. Logging on Free, reading on paid
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Signals,All
- **Answers:** Bearable, Flaredown, SmartBP, Clue · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Decide with P27: the daily check-in, flares, food reactions, the bowel log, blood pressure, period days and the person’s own trackers are kept on Free with no limit, and Pattern Finder, experiments, Trends beyond a short window and Reports stay paid. Bearable gives unlimited logging away; a record nobody can start for free never reaches the paid reading.

### Q20. Exertion and how it landed
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Signals,Trends
- **Answers:** Visible · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)

- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Insights,Food
- **Answers:** Cronometer, Yuka, Fig · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Decide with P27 and Q18: today’s nutrients with the food and supplement split, scanning a label, and one condition scored (or the For You card on a few foods a day) on Free, with gap foods, absorption, history, every condition and the household reading paid. Cronometer, Yuka and Fig all give their first look away.

### Q28. What can I make from what is here
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Insights,Food
- **Answers:** KitchenPal, SuperCook · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Recipes ranked by how much of each the kitchen already holds, items nearest their use-by first, filtered by the person’s conditions, allergies and diet, with what is missing sent to the grocery list in one tap.

### Q30. A recent window of Trends on Free
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Trends,All
- **Answers:** Bearable, Hevy, Cronometer, Guava, Clue · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Decide with P27, Q18 and Q25: the last 30 days of every Trends lens on Free, Keeping Up in full on Free for the daily-living audience, and one Pattern Finder candidate a month shown with its basis; six months, a year, Compare Two, experiments and the full finder paid.

Ingest and map them in the unified database, carry them across in Phase 5, and only then reach the live file through the swap; never by hand on foods_reference.db.

- **Answers:** Fitbod · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)

- **How:** A plain entry for every common marker in the lab list: what it measures, what moves it up or down (food, supplements, medicines, timing of the draw), which of the 19 conditions watch it, with an evidence tier and source, opened on tap from any result.

- **Ships by:** Android rebuild R1 · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Signals
- **Answers:** Cara Care · **Theme:** Check-ins and signals
- **How:** Pacer and spoken scripts shipped OTA in 1.0.57.22 (Signals > Calm). Recordings come in OTA since 1.0.57.23: kept in the Recordings folder in the shared folder, played in the app on the computer and opened in another app on the phone.

- **How:** expo-media-library saves the full camera picture, with its details, to the phone's gallery while the app keeps its two small sizes (X1, 1.0.53.7). expo-network tells Wi-Fi from mobile data, so "Send and fetch shared photos on Wi-Fi only" holds on the phone; until then lib/photoNative.ts reports unknown and photos go either way.

- **Answers:** iNaturalist, Merlin · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)

## Phase 5. The Worker and the relay (26 items)

### A14. Recalls matched to My Meds and scanned foods
- **Ships by:** Cloudflare Worker · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Insights,Life,Food
- **Answers:** Drugs.com · **Theme:** Medication logistics
- **How:** External data item 27: the Worker pre-fetches FDA recall feeds as one bundle and the phone matches names locally, so the med list never leaves it.

### C21. Try-before-install page
- **Ships by:** Cloudflare Worker · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** none
- **Answers:** Noom · **Theme:** Capture, reminders and the second audience
- **How:** A page on inside-story-site describing the app by audience. Collects nothing.

### F22. Weather beside symptoms

- **Answers:** Flaredown · **Theme:** Patterns and Trends
- **How:** daily_weather from the Worker bundle with a coarsened location (item 27), listed beside flares in lib/patternContext.ts. A typed city ships over the air; automatic location needs expo-location in R1.

### I24. What plant is this
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Garden
- **Answers:** PictureThis, Planta · **Theme:** Garden
- **How:** Reshaped 2026-09-29 by direct instruction: nothing in the app may cost a subscription or a charge, and the Pl@ntNet API is free only to 500 identifications a day for one account shared by every user, then paid. So the app names no plant itself. What Plant Is This, above the food search on Add a Planting, opens the free Pl@ntNet or Google Lens app on a phone (their websites on a computer), the person searches for the name it gave, and the planting records which app named it and how sure Pl@ntNet said it was. Every time it says an app’s name is a likely match and never to eat a plant on an app’s word alone. Built 1.0.56.2.

### O3. Messages between Lifestead users
- **Ships by:** Relay (Worker plus push) · **Size:** L · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Talking to people

### Q73. The Caregiver tier
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** L · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** CareClinic, Medisafe, Caring Village · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Free to download for the caregiver; the person cared for pays, and their first caregiver comes with their Individual plan. Linked by an invitation sent from the app; writing for another adult with consent or attestation, every change logged where both read it, missed doses told on time, and never usable as a cheaper Partner (Q89). Q74 to Q90 carry the rest, each built to beat the caregiver leader for that function.

### Q74. A free caregiver download, paid for by the person cared for
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** Medisafe (Medfriend), Caring Village · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** The caregiver installs free and is linked only by an invitation sent from the cared-for person’s app and accepted, signed by both device keys; the first caregiver comes with the cared-for person’s Individual plan, further caregivers are priced under P27, and a person with no device of their own can have their plan bought for them by a relative, still as their plan.

### Q75. Each person cared for kept apart
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** L · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** Caring Village · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Each person cared for is a separate sealed record on the caregiver’s device, never one database with a person column, so nothing of one person can show on another’s screen, reach another’s report or travel in another’s sync; every screen names whose record is open, and switching is one tap.

### Q76. The caregiver’s day across everyone
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Home,Schedules
- **Answers:** Caring Village, Jointly · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** One view of today’s doses, appointments, meals and tasks for every person cared for, each line in that person’s name and colour, read from each separate record without mixing them, with the caregiver’s own day beside it.

### Q77. Doses marked on someone’s behalf
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Schedules,Life
- **Answers:** Medisafe · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** The caregiver marks a dose taken, skipped or refused for the person, stamped with who marked it, beside the person’s own marks; refill counts and the interaction-rule timing warnings apply as they do for the person. Medfriend can only watch.

### Q78. Consent area by area, attestation where there is no capacity
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Profile,Life
- **Answers:** Caring Village, CareClinic · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** The person cared for chooses area by area what the caregiver reads and what they write, and can change or end it at any time; where the person cannot consent, the caregiver attests to their authority in plain words, and the app never judges capacity.

### Q79. The care circle and tasks people claim
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** L · **Tabs:** Life,Schedules
- **Answers:** Lotsa Helping Hands, ianacare · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Family, friends and paid aides invited into one person’s circle at the access each needs; rides, meals, visits and errands posted and claimed, and nobody in the circle sees health records they were not given.

### Q80. Updates to the people who ask
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** CaringBridge · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** The caregiver writes an update once and sends it to chosen people through the circle or the share sheet; nothing goes out that the caregiver did not write, and no record travels with it unless picked.

### Q81. Documents for each person cared for
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** Caring Village · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Power of attorney, advance directive, insurance cards, medication lists and discharge papers kept per person, sealed on the device and inside the vault, with an expiry date raising a reminder.

### Q82. An emergency card for each person cared for
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** Apple Medical ID, Caring Village · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Each person’s conditions, meds, allergies, contacts and directives on one card the caregiver opens offline in two taps, never behind a paywall (P28).

### Q83. Appointments: questions before, what was said after
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Schedules,Reports
- **Answers:** CareClinic · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Questions gathered for a visit from the records since the last one, what the clinician said written down after, and a report for that clinician from that one person’s record.

### Q84. What the caregiver noticed, kept apart from what the person said
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Signals
- **Answers:** CareClinic · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Symptoms, mood, sleep and behaviour a caregiver observes are marked as observed, so Pattern Finder and every report keep them apart from the person’s own account; this matters most for memory loss and for a person who cannot say.

### Q85. Handover between caregivers
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** Jointly, Caring Village · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** What happened since the last person was there (doses, meals, notes, anything changed) on one page the next caregiver opens, read from the change log (P31).

### Q86. Care costs for each person cared for
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** (nobody) · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Costs, who paid and insurance claims per person, on Finances and never mixed into the caregiver’s own money, so splitting costs among family is arithmetic rather than argument.

### Q87. The caregiver’s life too
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Life,Home
- **Answers:** ianacare · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** The caregiver’s sleep, appointments, breaks and support kept as their record, with respite and local help on the reading; no score, no burnout rating, nothing that says they are failing.

### Q88. When care ends
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Profile
- **Answers:** (nobody) · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** When the link ends or the person dies, the records go where the person said they should (P32, and “If something happens to me”), the caregiver keeps their notes and costs, and nothing is deleted unasked.

### Q89. A caregiver link can never stand in for Partner
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** The link runs one way, onto the cared-for person’s record and only the areas they consented to; nothing of the caregiver’s record travels back; meals and shopping are not shared both ways as Partner shares them; and the link gives the caregiver no paid features for their own records, which stay on whatever plan the caregiver has. Two people who set up caregiver links each way are paying two Individual plans, more than Partner, and the app says Partner costs less and shares more. Enforced in the allowlist (lib/peerRelationships.ts) and the entitlement gate (P27), never by trusting what the link is called.

### Q90. A paid user becoming a caregiver for their family
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** Caring Village · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** A person already on Individual or Partner becomes a caregiver for a parent or anyone in their extended family at no cost to themselves; the family member pays for the link through a plan of their own, which a relative may buy for them. The caregiver’s own records keep their full paid features beside each person they care for, kept apart (Q75).

### U13. What a helper writes arrives everywhere
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** Lotsa Helping Hands · **Theme:** What competitors' users complain about (2026-10-09)
- **How:** A helper's comment, task change or reminder on a shared item appears on every device of every person on the link, or says plainly that it has not arrived yet. With the caregiver work. Source: complaints/companions.md.

### A15. Pill identifier

### I23. Live AC Infinity readings
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** L · **Tabs:** Garden
- **Answers:** AC Infinity · **Theme:** Garden
- **How:** Ruled out 2026-09-28 by direct instruction. Built as an opt-in in 1.0.55.39 through the unpublished server AC Infinity's phone app uses, then removed entirely in 1.0.55.40: the app is sold, and a paid app reading another company's service needs that company's permission (App Store guideline 5.2.2 says so outright), so a device joins only when its maker offers a free, published way in, the way Ecowitt does with its gateways. What stays is Import Readings from a File (I19), which reads the history file a person saves from the AC Infinity app. Revisit only if AC Infinity publishes an API or grants permission in writing.

### I25. What is wrong with this plant
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Garden
- **Answers:** PictureThis · **Theme:** Garden
- **How:** Reshaped 2026-09-29 by direct instruction: nothing in the app may cost a subscription or a charge, so no paid diagnosis service and no vision model. What Is Wrong With It, under each planting, lists the three problems that crop is known for, asks where the trouble shows first and lists the shortages and look-alikes that show there, all from the crop guides and the plant nutrient reading, each put right from the soil. When nothing matches it opens the free Google Lens app and names the people who answer gardening questions for free. Any row can be written down on the planting as a Something wrong seen entry. Always the likeliest causes, never a diagnosis. Built 1.0.56.3.

### O4. Capture from other apps' notifications
- **Ships by:** Explicit opt-in only · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Talking to people

### O5. Lifestead as the default texting app
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** XL · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Talking to people
- **How:** Android only, Play policy likely refuses it, the person loses RCS, and it cannot exist on iPhone or desktop. Ruled out by the owner on 2026-09-26; kept on the list only as the record of that decision. O1, O2, C11 and O3 are the route instead.

### Z1. Photo sent to a vision model for ingredients

- **Answers:** MyFitnessPal, Eat This Much · **Theme:** Asked of you: these meet a standing rule or need a company server

- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** L · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** YNAB, Monarch · **Theme:** Asked of you: these meet a standing rule or need a company server
- **How:** Ruled out 2026-10-07 by direct instruction ("J1 only"). Plaid and Belvo need a company server holding a secret and charge the app per account or per call; GoCardless Bank Account Data closed on 2023-12-18; SimpleFIN Bridge (the person pays about $15 a year, the phone fetches directly) was the one route that fit, and it reaches US and Canadian banks only. J1, importing a bank export file, is the route: every country, no cost, nothing leaves the device.

### Z11. A clinician dashboard or live link
