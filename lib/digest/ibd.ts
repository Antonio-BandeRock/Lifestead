    summary: "Inflammatory bowel disease is an umbrella term for two different autoimmune conditions. Ulcerative colitis causes continuous inflammation limited to the colon and rectum. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the digestive tract from mouth to anus, often in patchy \"skip lesions\" rather than one continuous stretch, and can penetrate deeper into the intestinal wall than ulcerative colitis typically does. This distinction isn't academic.\n\nSeveral of the findings in this category, most strikingly how smoking affects each disease, run in different, even opposite, directions depending on which one someone actually has. The Gut & Microbiome category covers direct evidence from IBD research: an endoscopically-confirmed AIP diet trial and documented depletion of the same short-chain-fatty-acid-producing bacteria the whole gut-repair argument is built around. This category covers what's specific to actually living with and managing either disease.",

    summary: "Smoking's relationship with IBD is one of the most striking, well-documented paradoxes in autoimmune research: it's an established risk factor for developing and worsening Crohn's disease, while showing a paradoxical protective effect against ulcerative colitis. A recent, specific mechanism helps explain why.\n\nSmoking produces metabolites that let a particular mouth bacterium, Streptococcus mitis, establish itself in the gut, triggering an immune response through Th1 cells. In Crohn's disease, this worsens things, since Th1 cells are already central to the disease's inflammatory process. In ulcerative colitis, those same Th1 cells work against the disease's different underlying immune imbalance, calming inflammation instead.\n\nA separate, molecular-level mechanism adds to the Crohn's-specific harm: cigarette smoke upregulates a receptor (GPR15) that drives T cells toward becoming Th17 cells, the same inflammatory cell type the Gut & Microbiome research already names as central to autoimmune disease broadly. This is included as an important finding to know, not a suggestion to smoke for ulcerative colitis. Smoking carries enough separately well-established harm, cardiovascular disease, cancer, to outweigh this one narrow protective association many times over, the same standing caveat already applied to Hashimoto's smoking paradox.",

    summary: "Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), replacing all regular food with a complete liquid nutritional formula for a defined period, is a first-line therapy specifically for inducing remission in mild-to-moderate pediatric Crohn's disease, considered as effective as corticosteroid treatment by clinical guidance. The remission numbers are strong: one trial found 83% of pediatric patients in complete clinical remission after 6 weeks of EEN, and a separate trial using a reverse-engineered formula found 80% in remission after just 4 weeks. The mechanism traces back to the core gut-microbiome framework: research finds EEN works substantially by reshaping the gut microbiome itself, reducing proinflammatory microbial components rather than simply resting the bowel.\n\nThe practical limitation: adherence is hard, with about 38% of patients discontinuing early in one study, driven by taste, nausea, and discomfort from the nasogastric tube some patients need to complete the full liquid-only period. A first-line, food-based therapy the mission is built to take seriously, with a cost attached.",

    summary:
      "Restricting fiber during an active IBD flare is some of the most commonly given dietary advice in this whole condition, routinely handed out by clinicians. A direct check of the actual evidence behind it turns up a surprising gap: reviews find no evidence that a low-residue or low-fiber diet actually reduces inflammation during a flare, and only limited, weak research supporting fiber restriction at all, mostly inherited practice rather than demonstrated benefit.\n\nThe evidence runs, if anything, in the opposite direction for the bigger picture. A large dietary survey of 1,130 Crohn's disease patients found people in the highest quartile of fiber intake were less likely to have a flare within six months, and separate research finds adequate fiber intake (25-30 grams a day) linked to a healthier gut microbiome, lower inflammation markers, and better maintenance of remission. This isn't a case for eating high-fiber foods during active, severe symptoms, when short-term GI distress is a separate consideration worth managing with a doctor's guidance. It's a correction to how confidently the low-fiber default gets applied as a blanket rule rather than a short-term, symptom-driven adjustment.",

This is an important distinction to hold onto: a low-FODMAP diet targets symptom management for a separate overlapping issue, not inflammation itself, and isn't a substitute for the disease-modifying treatment (medication, and where appropriate, EEN) that actually treats IBD.

Research finds up to 50% of IBD patients develop at least one extraintestinal manifestation during their disease course, a symptom or complication in an organ system that has nothing to do with digestion on the surface.

A large, recent German primary care study found no significant overall association between IBD (either Crohn's or ulcerative colitis) and autoimmune thyroiditis. That's a meaningful null result from a study that went looking. The same study did find one specific exception: among patients 65 and older, IBD was associated with a significantly higher risk specifically of Graves' disease, not Hashimoto's, roughly tripled in both Crohn's and ulcerative colitis patients in that age group.\n\nIBD doesn't carry the same broad, quantified Hashimoto's-comorbidity signal that T1D and celiac disease do, and pretending otherwise just because these conditions all share the word \"autoimmune\" would misrepresent the actual research.

The reason: severe, sudden myelosuppression (a dangerous drop in blood cell production) can develop in an estimated 3% of patients, more likely with reduced TPMT function, and more likely in the first eight weeks of treatment.\n\nA related gene, NUDT15, matters especially for patients of Asian or Hispanic descent, where it's a more common cause of thiopurine intolerance than TPMT variants alone.

Ulcerative colitis came first, in 1875, when English physicians Wilks and Moxon distinguished it from infectious diarrheal disease. Crohn's disease wasn't formally described until 1932, when Burrill Crohn, Leon Ginzberg, and Gordon Oppenheimer published a landmark 14-case paper describing what they initially called \"regional ileitis,\" an advance over the era's default assumption that any small-intestine disease must be tuberculosis.\n\nEarlier isolated case observations actually predate the 1932 paper (Morgagni in the 1700s, Berg in 1898, Lesniowski in 1904, Dalziel in 1913), meaning the disease existed in medical records well before it was formally named and understood as its condition. The modern genetic turning point came in the early 2000s: discovery of the NOD2/CARD15 gene mutation gave the first molecular explanation for Crohn's genetic susceptibility, opening the door to the TNF-alpha-targeting biologic therapies (infliximab, adalimumab, both covered in the medication research) that transformed treatment in the years that followed.",

This makes preconception planning more consequential here than in many other conditions covered: guidance is to achieve disease remission before conception whenever possible, and, even though it runs against a common, understandable instinct, to KEEP taking IBD medication through pregnancy rather than stopping it out of caution, since stopping is what actually raises flare risk.\n\nThe reassuring medication-safety finding: anti-TNF biologics (covered in the medication research) are considered safe across multiple registries and observational studies, with continuing them through the third trimester specifically linked to a lower flare risk and no increased infant infection risk in the first year of life from in-utero exposure.",

Results vary across different trial centers, with steroid-free remission reported at 32% in one trial and 44% in another, and a 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found the evidence base still developing, calling for more standardized, better-designed trials before this becomes a routine option.\n\nThe proposed mechanisms line up directly with the already-established gut-health research: correcting microbiota dysbiosis, reducing intestinal permeability, and increasing short-chain fatty acid production, the same gut-barrier-protective pathway covered for autoimmune disease broadly.

    title: 'Vitamin D Deficiency Is Common, and Tracks Directly With How Active IBD Actually Is',
    teaser: 'Studies find vitamin D deficiency in 22-64% of IBD patients, with deficiency directly correlating with higher inflammatory markers, more relapses, more surgery, and a slower response to biologic medications.',
    summary: "Vitamin D deficiency is common, and more than an incidental finding in inflammatory bowel disease, it tracks directly with disease severity itself. Studies find deficiency prevalence ranging from 22% to 63% depending on the population and how deficiency is defined, with one study of 504 IBD patients finding 49.8% deficient overall and 10.9% severely so, and clinical observation finding roughly 60-64% of both Crohn's and ulcerative colitis patients affected. This is more than a coincidental overlap: research finds a statistically significant reverse correlation between lower vitamin D levels and higher inflammatory markers, and deficiency itself associated with a higher rate of relapse, increased risk of needing surgery, and a slower response to biologic medications.\n\nThe biological explanation involves vitamin D's active form playing a direct role in immune regulation and gut barrier function, the exact mechanism covered in the gut-microbiome Vitamin D/CLDN2 tight-junction research. This makes vitamin D testing and correction a concrete, actionable piece of IBD management, not just a general wellness recommendation, someone with IBD experiencing more frequent flares or a weaker response to their current biologic treatment has an evidence-backed reason to ask specifically about their vitamin D status.",

    teaser: 'Research finds having older siblings, and other markers of richer early-life microbial exposure, tied to lower IBD risk, while a more sterile early environment appears to leave lasting gaps in immune training.',
    summary: "The hygiene hypothesis proposes that reduced microbial exposure in early life, a byproduct of modern hygiene and living conditions, may leave the developing immune system less well \"trained,\" plausibly raising the risk of immune-mediated diseases like IBD later on. Animal research finds improved hygiene tied to decreased microbiota diversity and a shift toward a more proinflammatory immune response pattern, with early childhood specifically identified as the critical window for the developing gut immune system, microbiome, and mucosal-bacterial relationships to establish themselves.\n\nHuman research finds concrete, supporting evidence: having older siblings, a marker of greater early-life microbial exposure, is associated with reduced IBD risk, while research finds cesarean delivery (which bypasses the vaginal microbial exposure of a natural birth) can slow the pace of a newborn's gut microbiome colonization.\n\nThe proposed protective mechanism ties directly to the already-established gut-immunology research: diverse early microbial exposure promotes the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and boosts anti-inflammatory signaling molecules like IL-10, the same protective pathway covered elsewhere for autoimmune disease broadly. This is fascinating, if not yet fully actionable, context for why IBD rates have risen alongside modernization, and it reinforces, from a completely different angle, why supporting a diverse gut microbiome throughout life, not just in infancy, remains a central piece of the core mission.",

    teaser: 'Research finds secondary loss of response to anti-TNF biologics affecting 13-21% of patients per year, often caused by the body developing antibodies against the drug itself, a testable, and addressable problem.',
    summary: "Anti-TNF biologics (covered by name for both RA and IBD elsewhere in the medication research) can stop working over time in a well-documented, and specifically named phenomenon: secondary loss of response. Research finds this affects 13-21% of patients per year, on top of primary non-response (the drug never working in the first place) affecting up to a third of patients from the start.\n\nThe most common underlying cause is immunogenicity, the body developing its antibodies against the biologic drug (called anti-drug antibodies), which directly lowers the actual drug level in the blood and blocks its biological activity. Practical solutions exist once this is identified: therapeutic drug monitoring (measuring both the drug's blood level and any anti-drug antibodies present) can guide treatment adjustments, and research finds adding an immunomodulator medication alongside the biologic can help reverse antibody-driven loss of response in some patients.\n\nA large UK study (13,222 patients) found people who lost response to their first anti-TNF drug had better outcomes switching to a different class of biologic entirely rather than trying a second anti-TNF. If an IBD medication that used to work well starts losing effectiveness, this is a well-understood, and named clinical phenomenon with testable next steps, not a sign that IBD itself has simply become untreatable, and it's worth raising directly with a gastroenterologist rather than assuming nothing more can be done.",

    teaser: "Roughly a fifth of IBD patients develop anemia, and when they do, it's iron deficiency the large majority of the time.",
    summary:
      "A cross-sectional study of 99 IBD patients found anemia in 20.5% of those with Crohn's disease and 23.6% of those with ulcerative colitis. Among the patients who had anemia, iron deficiency specifically accounted for 69.6% of cases in Crohn's and 76.7% in ulcerative colitis, making it the dominant cause by a wide margin rather than one possibility among several. The primary driver is chronic, often invisible blood loss from inflamed intestinal tissue, not simply eating too little iron.\n\nA second mechanism compounds it: inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF, interferon-gamma) suppress the body's production of erythropoietin, the hormone that signals bone marrow to make red blood cells, while a related pathway (hepcidin) actively traps iron inside intestinal immune cells where it can't be used. Iron malabsorption from diet alone only becomes a major factor when a large portion of the upper digestive tract is affected. This layered mechanism explains why anemia in IBD often doesn't respond to diet changes by themselves. Someone whose fatigue or breathlessness has been chalked up to just the disease has a testable, usually correctable explanation worth raising directly.",

    teaser: 'The SONIC trial found combining a biologic with an immunomodulator put 57% of patients into steroid-free remission, against 44% on the biologic alone and 30% on the immunomodulator alone.',
    summary:
      "For a meaningful stretch of time, doctors treating moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease faced an unresolved question: does adding an older immunomodulator drug (azathioprine) to a newer biologic (infliximab) actually help, or does it just add side-effect risk without added benefit? The SONIC trial gave a decisive answer. It randomized 508 adults who had never used either drug type before into three groups: infliximab alone, azathioprine alone, or both together. At 26 weeks, 56.8% of the combination group reached steroid-free clinical remission, compared with 44.4% on infliximab alone and 30.0% on azathioprine alone.\n\nDirect evidence of actual gut healing (mucosal healing, confirmed by endoscopy) followed the same pattern: 43.9% in the combination group versus 30.1% on infliximab alone and 16.5% on azathioprine alone. This is specific evidence that a combination approach can outperform either medication used by itself, not just theoretical reasoning about mechanism, and it remains a standard reference point in how Crohn's treatment decisions get made today. Which specific medications, and whether combination therapy makes sense for a given person, stays an individual medical decision (added infection risk comes with added immune suppression), not something to read off this one trial alone, but it's worth-having context for that conversation.",

    summary: "The already-built research covers exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), a liquid-formula-only diet with strong evidence for inducing Crohn's remission, alongside its limitation: many people find it hard to sustain, since it means giving up ordinary food entirely for weeks. The Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) is a more recent, structured alternative built to address exactly that gap, a whole-food diet, not a liquid formula, designed to specifically limit foods with documented links to gut inflammation, animal fat, certain emulsifiers and additives, gluten, and dairy, while still allowing ordinary meals.\n\nA randomized controlled trial in 78 children directly compared CDED (paired with a smaller amount of supplemental formula) against standard EEN. At 6 weeks, both approaches induced remission in a comparable share of children (roughly 75 to 80%), and CDED was better tolerated, with meaningfully higher rates of people actually completing the full course of treatment.\n\nAt 12 weeks, a majority of children who reached remission were still in remission on CDED. This is progress toward an inflammatory-bowel-disease treatment someone can actually sustain day to day, not just a theoretically effective one, and it's a concrete example of dietary structure itself doing therapeutic work, not simply avoiding a short list of trigger foods.",

    summary:
      "The biologic research (the SONIC combination trial, anti-TNF loss of response) raises a practical follow-up question: once someone's on a biologic like infliximab, how does a doctor actually know if the dose is right? Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) answers this by directly measuring the medication's blood level (trough concentration) rather than relying on symptoms alone, since a meaningful share of apparent treatment failure turns out to be a dosing problem rather than a lack of response.\n\nThe landmark TAXIT trial tested a PROACTIVE version of this (a scheduled blood-level check adjusting dose toward a target range of 3 to 7 micrograms per milliliter, before problems appear) against a REACTIVE approach (checking blood levels only after symptoms return). The result: no significant difference in remission rates at 1 year between the two approaches, but the proactive group had significantly fewer relapses during the full follow-up period (7% versus 17%).\n\nMajor gastroenterology associations still mostly recommend the simpler, reactive approach as standard, with proactive monitoring considered more useful but more debated, this is a worth-raising question for anyone whose biologic seems to be working less well than expected: has an actual blood level ever been checked, or has the dose only ever been adjusted based on symptoms alone?",

The important, practical finding: patients who QUIT smoking had a relapse risk that dropped to match lifelong nonsmokers, essentially fully reversing the excess risk, not just partially reducing it.\n\nAn earlier intervention study described this benefit as comparable in magnitude to starting an immunosuppressant medication.

    summary:
      "Inflammatory bowel disease that first appears later in life follows a distinct pattern from the same disease in a younger person, and that difference has practical consequences for how quickly it gets recognized. Elderly-onset IBD often presents atypically and less severely, showing up as mild diarrhea, rectal bleeding, or vague abdominal discomfort that can easily be mistaken for ischemic or diverticular colitis rather than the more classic, more clearly IBD-looking picture doctors are trained to recognize in younger patients.\n\nThe disease pattern itself differs too: multiple population-based studies have found late-onset ulcerative colitis tends toward left-sided involvement, and late-onset Crohn's disease tends to affect the colon rather than the small bowel, the opposite distribution from younger-onset cases. The practical cost of this atypical picture is a longer diagnostic delay, up to 6 years in elderly patients compared with roughly 2 years in younger adults in one dataset, and a higher initial misdiagnosis rate, 51% of adults over 40 receiving an incorrect first diagnosis compared with 39% of younger patients in the same study.\n\nThe wide list of other conditions that can look similar in an older adult, infectious colitis, diverticular disease, NSAID-related injury, radiation colitis, or colorectal cancer, means careful evaluation matters even more than usual, and persistent bowel symptoms in an older adult deserve follow-through rather than an easy default assumption.",

    summary:
      "The extraintestinal-manifestations research names complications reaching beyond the gut itself; perianal fistulas (abnormal tunnels forming between the bowel and skin near the anus) are a common, and often under-discussed complication of Crohn's disease specifically. Research finds roughly 35% of Crohn's patients develop at least one fistula, with 70-80% of these classified as complex.\n\nAn international patient survey found the impact reaching well past physical symptoms into relationships, social life, and work life, with pain, scarring, discharge, fecal incontinence, and sexual difficulties all named directly as contributing factors to a measurable drop in quality of life. Even with the best current medical and surgical therapy combined, only about a third of patients remain in sustained remission at one year, with research finding ACTIVE INFLAMMATION itself, not simply the fistula's presence, the biggest driver of quality of life, a direct reason staying on top of disease control matters even when a fistula itself can't be fully resolved.",

      "The corticosteroid-hypertension research already flags one steroid side effect; bone loss is a second, more surprising one, since it turns out NOT to depend on steroid use alone. Studies find osteopenia in 22-77% of IBD patients and full osteoporosis in 17-41%, figures that vary by disease location and severity but are consistently, substantially elevated.\n\nCorticosteroids do carry a fast-acting risk, measurable bone-density loss and increased fracture risk within just a few months of starting treatment, even at a low dose of 5mg/day, but the more surprising finding is that low bone density shows up in NEWLY DIAGNOSED patients who have never received any steroid treatment at all, pointing directly at chronic inflammation itself as an independent cause.\n\nThe specific mechanism: inflammatory cytokines covered elsewhere in this category (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1, IL-17) directly stimulate the body's bone-dissolving cells through a named signaling pathway (RANKL/RANK/OPG). The practical consequence: IBD patients carry a 15-45% higher risk of an osteoporotic fracture than the general population, worth a direct conversation about bone-density screening regardless of whether steroids have ever been part of treatment.",

Meta-analyses consistently find IBD patients carrying two to three times the general population's risk of developing a blood clot.\n\nThe most clinically useful finding is WHEN that risk peaks: research found the hazard ratio for a clot reaching 8.4 during an active disease flare compared to controls, still elevated (2.1-fold) even during remission, direct evidence the underlying inflammation itself, not just hospitalization or surgery, drives the risk. Identified contributing factors include a prior clot (a 4.44-fold risk multiplier), urgent surgery, blood transfusions, low blood albumin, and corticosteroid use, each independently raising risk further.\n\nA useful, reassuring finding: anti-TNF therapy, one of the biologic treatments, was NOT associated with increased clot risk, unlike corticosteroids. This elevated risk is exactly why hospitalized IBD patients, especially during a flare or after surgery, are often given preventive blood thinners as a matter of course, an evidence-based practice, not a surprising one.",

A separate study in the elderly IBD population found both comparably effective and safe, useful data for a population often excluded from the original approval trials.\n\nThe worth-knowing exception: a study in pediatric and young-adult patients found vedolizumab producing significantly higher 1-year steroid-free remission specifically in ulcerative colitis and IBD-unclassified patients (61 percent versus 32 percent for ustekinumab), while the same study found the two performing comparably in Crohn's disease patients (63 versus 68 percent at 6 months), direct evidence the right choice can depend on which specific IBD subtype is being treated, not just biologic availability or cost.

Data finds this common: roughly 50 to 70 percent of Crohn's patients develop stricturing or penetrating (fistula-forming) complications within 10 years of diagnosis, evidence this isn't a rare, unusual outcome but a common trajectory of the disease left to progress.\n\nThe most direct, practical number: a study found the cumulative risk of Crohn's-related surgery in patients with stricturing disease climbing steadily, from 18.0 percent at year 1 to 46.4 percent by year 5, and a separate comparison found patients with a stricturing-penetrating phenotype needing surgery at a striking 77.7 percent rate versus just 12.2 percent for patients with purely inflammatory (non-stricturing) Crohn's, direct evidence of how much this specific disease behavior changes the practical outlook.\n\nResearch also finds patients with strictures facing significantly higher rates of hospitalization, steroid dependency, and repeated endoscopy along the way, not just eventual surgery. This higher-stakes trajectory is exactly why the early, aggressive treatment approach (matching the already-established window-of-opportunity research for other conditions) matters specifically for Crohn's disease, worth discussing directly with a gastroenterologist rather than waiting to see how the disease behaves on its own.",

Diff toxins present in 5.5 to 20 percent of cases, an important number given how directly this complicates clinical decision-making: a person with IBD experiencing worsening diarrhea could be having a disease flare (which treatment escalates immunosuppression to control) or a C. Diff infection (which treatment requires antibiotics and REDUCING immunosuppression), two opposite treatment directions that look clinically identical without a direct stool test to distinguish them.\n\nResearch names the specific, elevated-risk factors directly: active colonic inflammation itself, broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, prolonged hospitalization, and corticosteroid or combined immunosuppressive therapy, all identifiable risk multipliers.

      "The extraintestinal-manifestation research already establishes joint, eye, and liver involvement beyond the gut itself, and the skin carries its two distinct manifestations worth their direct, quantified coverage. A large cohort study of 2,402 IBD patients found erythema nodosum, tender, red nodules typically on the shins, evidence of inflammation in the fat layer beneath the skin, present in 4.0 percent of patients, evidence this is a common, if still minority, extraintestinal sign. Pyoderma gangrenosum, a much rarer but far more serious skin condition (painful, rapidly enlarging ulcers that can develop from even minor skin trauma), was present in 0.75 percent of the same cohort.\n\nThe useful, practical distinction: erythema nodosum tends to track closely with active intestinal inflammation and often improves as the underlying IBD itself is brought under control, while pyoderma gangrenosum can behave more independently, sometimes appearing even during disease remission, and research names it as having the most debilitating disease course of the two.\n\nResearch also found both conditions more commonly associated with Crohn's disease than with ulcerative colitis specifically. Erythema nodosum's common, largely reassuring pattern is different from pyoderma gangrenosum's rarer, more serious one: a new, unexplained, rapidly worsening skin ulcer deserves urgent evaluation rather than being assumed to be a minor, self-resolving IBD-related skin change.",

A mouse model of colitis (induced with dextran sodium sulfate, a standard, well-established way to model IBD-like intestinal inflammation) found that intestinal inflammation directly triggered a measurable inflammatory response in the hippocampus itself, including activation of the brain's immune cells (microglia) and increased inflammatory signaling genes, alongside measurable deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis markers after both a single, acute flare and after chronic, repeated inflammation.\n\nThe proposed mechanism is direct and specific: the same neural progenitor cells that would otherwise become new neurons carry receptors for the pro-inflammatory cytokines gut inflammation produces, and a sustained inflammatory environment in that cell niche directly works against normal neurogenic activity, rather than the gut and brain effects being separate, coincidental problems. This is animal research, not yet directly confirmed in human IBD patients, but it offers a specific, mechanistic explanation connecting active gut inflammation to the brain changes that plausibly underlie the mood and cognitive symptoms covered in this category's research, a biological throughline rather than two separate, loosely-associated conditions.",

Someone can report feeling better while their gut is still inflamed, and blood and stool tests will say so. A randomized controlled study from a German university gastroenterology department gave people with active Crohn's disease ten sessions of traditional acupuncture with moxibustion or a sham procedure over four weeks. Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores fell significantly further in the acupuncture group. The same group ran a parallel trial in mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis with the same design. Both are small, and in both the sham group also improved, which is the pattern that recurs throughout this field.\n\nA 2022 randomized controlled trial published in eClinicalMedicine went past symptom scores in mild to moderate Crohn's disease, reporting improvement in symptoms alongside changes in intestinal microbiota and in inflammatory markers. Measuring inflammation directly is what separates a treatment doing something biological from a treatment making someone feel better about the same disease.\n\nTwo boundaries belong with this. None of these trials tested acupuncture as a replacement for the drugs that induce and maintain remission, and stopping those is how flares and complications happen.
