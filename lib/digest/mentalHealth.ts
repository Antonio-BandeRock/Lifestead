    summary:
      "The SMILES trial, led by Professor Felice Jacka's team and published in BMC Medicine in 2017, was the first randomized controlled trial specifically designed to test whether a dietary intervention itself, not just diet's association with mood, could treat clinical depression. Over 12 weeks, participants with moderate-to-severe depression either received individual nutritional counseling toward a modified Mediterranean-style diet from a clinical dietitian, or a matched social-support control with no dietary component. The result: 32.3 percent of the diet-intervention group reached clinical remission, against 8.0 percent of the control group, a clinically meaningful difference (a number-needed-to-treat of 4.1, meaning roughly one in four people treated this way achieved a benefit specifically attributable to the diet change).\n\nAn important detail from the trial's analysis: the benefit wasn't explained by weight loss or increased physical activity, it tracked directly with how much someone improved their diet, the strongest evidence yet that food itself, not just its downstream effects, can measurably move clinical depression.",

    teaser: 'Gut bacteria make roughly 90% of the body\'s serotonin, but that gut-made serotonin does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The documented mood mechanism runs through a different molecule entirely.',
    summary:
      "IBS's gut-serotonin research under Conditions on Life documents that specialized gut cells produce the large majority of the body's serotonin, and that this system directly governs gut motility. A common but imprecise extension of that fact claims this gut-made serotonin also travels to the brain and directly shapes mood. It does not: peripheral serotonin, including the kind gut cells produce, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, and the brain synthesizes its separate serotonin supply from dietary tryptophan.\n\nThe actual, better-documented mechanism connecting gut health to mood runs through short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, propionate, and especially butyrate, produced when gut bacteria ferment fiber from whole foods. A 2024 review in General Psychiatry details how these SCFAs regulate DNA methylation and histone acetylation in brain cells and microglia, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine activity and promoting brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) synthesis, and finds fecal SCFA levels consistently lower in people with depression than in controls.\n\nButyrate specifically shows an antidepressant-like effect in animal studies, reversing markers of low energy and anhedonia. Fiber-rich whole foods feed the bacteria that make SCFAs, a documented, if still-developing, path from diet to mood.",

    summary:
      "Refined carbohydrates and free sugars, stripped of the fiber and protein that would normally slow digestion, produce a fast, pronounced rise in blood glucose. The body's insulin response to that spike can overshoot, driving glucose back down quickly enough to trigger a counter-regulatory stress response: the release of cortisol and adrenaline to push stored glucose back into circulation. That hormone response, not the low blood sugar number alone, is what produces the acute irritability, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating people commonly describe after a sugar crash.\n\nSeparately from this hour-to-hour pattern, a growing body of research finds insulin resistance itself, the same underlying problem driving Type 2 Diabetes, PCOS, and MASLD, functions as a shared biological mechanism with depression rather than just a statistical companion to it: defective brain insulin signaling affects the reward system, neurogenesis, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis, and inflammatory signaling (TNF-alpha) has been shown to directly promote both impaired insulin signaling and depressive-like behavior in the same pathway.

Low vitamin D status correlates with more depressive symptoms in observational research.\n\nTrial evidence for whether supplementing vitamin D improves depression has moved less consistently: a 2014 meta-analysis found no significant benefit, largely because most included trials enrolled people who were not vitamin D deficient to begin with, while newer, larger analyses, including a 2024 dose-response meta-analysis of 31 trials and over 24,000 people, find a measurable reduction in depressive symptoms, most consistently at shorter follow-up windows.\n\nThis sits alongside the more conservative vitamin D entries under Essential Nutrients (the 2024 Endocrine Society guideline against routine population-wide testing and supplementation, and the VITAL trial's null result for cancer and cardiovascular prevention), evidence for a depression-specific benefit doesn't override that broader conservative stance for otherwise healthy adults, it's a distinct, still-developing question rather than a settled one.",

Framing either one as diet-caused overstates what the evidence supports and risks blaming a person or a parent for a condition rooted in brain structure and genetics.\n\nWhat a substantial and growing body of peer-reviewed research does support: nutritional intake measurably modulates neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter synthesis, and gut-brain signaling in ways that change how severe symptoms are day to day, the same distinction the broader mental-health research already draws between diet as a modifiable risk factor and diet as a cause. The entries that follow cover the specific, individually-cited evidence for each condition.",

    title: 'Two Randomized Trials Found Specific Foods and Additives Worsening ADHD Symptoms',
    teaser: 'A restricted elimination diet improved symptoms in 64% of children in a Lancet trial, with a measurable relapse on reintroducing trigger foods, and a separate Lancet trial found artificial food colors and a common preservative directly increasing hyperactivity. Pooled across every trial of both, the average effect is small.',
    summary:
      "The INCA study (Pelsser et al., The Lancet, 2011), a randomized controlled trial, placed children with ADHD on a strict, restricted elimination diet. A significant, clinically meaningful reduction in ADHD symptoms occurred in 64% (32 of 50) of the children, and reintroducing the identified trigger foods produced a measurable behavioral relapse in those same responders, direct evidence that specific, non-allergic food sensitivities were driving a meaningful share of their symptoms, rather than a placebo effect.\n\nA separate, larger randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (McCann et al., The Lancet, 2007, often called the Southampton study, 297 children total) tested common artificial food colors (including tartrazine, sunset yellow, and carmoisine) combined with the preservative sodium benzoate against a placebo drink, and found the additive mixture measurably increased hyperactivity in the general child population, not just in children already diagnosed with ADHD. This finding prompted the FDA to hold a public hearing and review the evidence on food dyes specifically because of this trial's size and rigor.\n\nSet against the whole literature rather than its two strongest trials, the effect is smaller than either headline reads. A meta-analysis (Nigg et al., Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2012) pooled 10 studies of dietary restriction and 24 of synthetic food colors, and found restriction diets reducing ADHD symptoms at g = 0.29 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.53), a small effect, and food colors at g = 0.18 by parent report, falling to 0.12 once adjusted for likely publication bias.\n\nThe 64% figure is the share of children who responded inside one trial, not the share of children who would respond, and the pooled authors note that the food color effects came either from small samples or from a literature carrying publication bias. A specific child can be a responder while the average child is helped a little. Neither trial identifies a single food or additive as universally responsible, elimination testing under guidance is the path to finding what matters for one specific person.",

    title: 'Omega-3s, Zinc, and Blood Sugar Stability Each Carry Documented, if Modest, Evidence for ADHD',
    teaser: 'A meta-analysis of 534 youth found omega-3 supplementation improved ADHD symptom scores, though the most comprehensive reviews find the effect limited on the disorder\'s core symptoms specifically.',
    summary:
      "A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis (Neuropsychopharmacology) pooled seven randomized controlled trials covering 534 youth with ADHD and found omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation improved clinical symptom scores, with a separate pooled set of 3 trials (214 youth) also finding improved attention-related cognitive measures. The EPA-versus-DHA depression entry already establishes that these two fatty acids aren't interchangeable, and the caveat applies here too: the most comprehensive reviews of this same evidence find the effect on ADHD's core diagnostic symptoms specifically more limited than the broader symptom-score improvement suggests.\n\nThe proposed mechanism connects to zinc: zinc acts as a cofactor in dopamine synthesis and directly regulates how the dopamine transporter clears dopamine from synapses, and omega-3 deficiency has been shown to disrupt zinc metabolism in brain tissue, tying the two nutrients to the same dopamine pathway rather than working through separate mechanisms.\n\nSeparately, a 2025 Frontiers in Nutrition study mapping the biochemical nutrient profiles of neurodivergent children and adults against standard intake references found baseline deficiencies in omega-3s, zinc, vitamin D, and B vitamins more common in this population than in the general one. On blood sugar specifically, a 2026 systematic review of dietary carbohydrates and ADHD symptoms found a mixed, heterogeneous evidence base, refined carbohydrates and added sugar track with worse symptom severity in most, not all, of the studies reviewed, the glycemic-instability entry covers the shared blood-sugar-to-mood mechanism in more depth.",

    teaser: 'A systematic review found reduced short-chain fatty acid production and inflammatory-pathway enrichment in gut bacteria correlating directly with how severe someone\'s OCD symptoms are.',
    summary:
      "The SCFA gut-mood mechanism entry covers how fiber-derived short-chain fatty acids, not gut-made serotonin crossing the blood-brain barrier, connect gut health to mood generally. A systematic review specific to OCD (mapping the disorder's biology to gut-relevant pathways) found the same underlying pattern with a disorder-specific detail: reduced short-chain-fatty-acid-producing capacity in the gut microbiome, enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacterial pathways, and measurable markers of intestinal barrier disruption all correlated with OCD severity specifically, not just general mood symptoms.\n\nThe proposed chain of events: a compromised gut barrier lets bacterial byproducts (endotoxins) reach the bloodstream, triggering low-grade systemic inflammation, and circulating inflammatory cytokines that cross the blood-brain barrier activate microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, in ways that disrupt serotonin signaling and worsen the intrusive, looping thought patterns central to OCD. This is an active, still-developing research area, tiered moderate for exactly that reason, evidence of correlation and a plausible mechanism, not yet a proven treatment pathway.",

    summary:
      "OCD involves excess signaling through glutamate, the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter, within the Cortico-Striato-Thalamo-Cortical circuit. A narrative review in Nutrients lays out the proposed mechanism: shifting the brain's fuel source from glucose to ketone bodies increases glutamate clearance and shifts its balance toward GABA, the brain's primary calming neurotransmitter, alongside separate proposed effects on mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and inflammation, several of the same pathways.\n\nThe clinical evidence behind this mechanism is documented but still small: a case series of three patients following a ketogenic diet reached OCD remission and came off medication entirely, with an average 90.5% reduction in their Y-BOCS symptom scores (the standard clinical measure for OCD severity), and a separate case report found a treatment-resistant patient's symptoms improving on ketogenic metabolic therapy even before starting exposure and response prevention therapy, suggesting the metabolic shift itself, not just the added therapy, was doing measurable work.\n\nThe review's authors state directly that research on ketogenic diets for OCD is still lacking, these are individually documented cases, not yet a randomized trial, and this entry is tiered weak specifically because case series and case reports, however striking, cannot rule out placebo effect or regression to the mean the way a controlled trial can.",
