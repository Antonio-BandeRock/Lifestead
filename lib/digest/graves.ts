    teaser: 'The most common cause of an overactive thyroid, and a distinct disease with its food and lifestyle evidence base.',
    summary: "Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, an overactive thyroid, and it's autoimmune: the body's own immune system makes an antibody (called TSI or TRAb, covered in full below) that binds to and stimulates the same receptor TSH normally uses, driving the thyroid to overproduce hormone.\n\nThat's a structurally different mechanism from an antibody that attacks and gradually destroys thyroid tissue, and it means several findings here, smoking's effect, iodine's role, even some of the same nutrients, land differently for Graves' than they do for other thyroid conditions covered elsewhere. Diet won't cure Graves' disease, and nothing here replaces an endocrinologist's treatment plan. What follows is what the actual research supports.",

    summary:
      "Iodine has a two-edged reputation for thyroid health generally, and it cuts its specific way for Graves'. Excess iodine intake is a documented trigger for Graves' disease itself, and people previously treated with antithyroid drugs, or with a prior iodine deficiency, are especially prone to developing iodine-induced hyperthyroidism when iodine intake rises.\n\nSeparately, if antithyroid drug treatment is already underway, excess iodine in someone actively being treated for Graves' can reduce how well those drugs actually work. This isn't a case for iodine avoidance at any cost. Research also finds adequate (not excessive, not deficient) iodine intake tracks with better remission rates and better long-term control than either too little or too much, making this a Goldilocks nutrient here, not a simple \"avoid it\" rule.",

The selenium group showed measured improvement in both eye-disease severity and disease-specific quality of life, and those gains held up even after supplementation ended.\n\nThat's a strong result for a specific population: mild orbitopathy.

    summary: "Smoking is well-established as harmful in nearly every way, and for Graves' disease specifically it carries a well-documented, dose-dependent risk. A meta-analysis covering 56 studies found smoking (current or past) significantly raises the risk of thyroid eye disease, and an earlier, large meta-analysis found the association even sharper for Graves' ophthalmopathy than for Graves' disease alone.\n\nThe risk rises with each additional cigarette smoked per day, and even partial smoking reduction appears to lower risk somewhat. It lands differently for different thyroid conditions: the Hashimoto's research documents a separate, counterintuitive finding that smoking tracks with LOWER risk of developing Hashimoto's thyroiditis specifically. The two findings aren't in tension with each other; they're two different diseases with two different relationships to the same habit. This is one of the clearest, most direct reasons smoking-cessation counseling belongs as a named part of Graves' treatment, not just general health advice repeated out of habit.",

      "Methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are the two main antithyroid drugs used to control Graves' disease, and both carry two specific, if uncommon, serious risks. Agranulocytosis, a dangerous drop in infection-fighting white blood cells, occurs in an estimated 0.2 to 0.5% of patients on either drug, and for methimazole specifically the risk rises with dose: from about 0.13% at 10mg/day up to about 0.47% at 30mg/day. The actionable warning signs are sore throat, fever, chills, or infections of the gums or skin, reasons to stop the drug and seek care immediately, not wait it out.\n\nLiver injury is the second risk, and the two drugs differ here in an important way: methimazole's liver risk is generally lower and can be caught through routine liver-function monitoring, but PTU's liver injury can come on rapidly and unpredictably enough that routine bloodwork isn't reliably protective, meaning symptoms (fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, fever, sore throat) are the trigger to stop PTU immediately and get liver function and a white blood cell count checked, not a scheduled lab visit.",

At diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity for confirming Graves' run in the upper 90s. More useful for someone already being treated: a baseline TRAb level below 10 IU/L tracks with a 63% remission rate on antithyroid drugs, compared to 39% for people above that threshold, and higher levels (above 15 IU/L) track with a higher chance of the drug taking longer than six months to bring the disease under control.\n\nThe single most actionable number in this whole entry: whether TSAb is still positive at the moment antithyroid drugs are stopped predicts relapse directly, 79% relapse with a positive result at withdrawal versus 33% with a negative one, a six-fold difference in risk. Ask for this test not just once at diagnosis, but specifically again before any conversation about stopping antithyroid drug treatment.",

    summary:
      "Excess thyroid hormone speeds up the normal bone-remodeling cycle, tipping the balance toward faster bone breakdown than bone formation can keep up with. In untreated hyperthyroidism, this is a measured effect, not a theoretical one: bone mineral density can run 10 to 15% lower in the spine and hip compared to someone with normal thyroid function. This complicates the usual assumption that getting thyroid levels back to normal automatically fixes it: TRAb, the same antibody covered above, appears to keep driving bone loss on its own even after someone reaches a euthyroid (normal thyroid hormone) state, contributing to a further 8 to 12% reduction in bone density independent of hormone levels themselves.\n\nA DEXA (bone density) scan is the direct way this gets checked, a reasonable thing to ask for given a history of hyperthyroidism, not assumed unnecessary just because current labs look normal. For anyone with confirmed bone loss, bisphosphonate medications are an evidence-supported option worth discussing directly.",

They block many of the immediate, uncomfortable symptoms of excess thyroid hormone, rapid heart rate, tremor, anxiety, heat intolerance, while antithyroid drugs or another definitive treatment work on the actual underlying cause, which typically takes weeks to bring hormone levels down meaningfully.\n\nThe two drugs do different jobs: one (methimazole or PTU) treats the disease, the other (a beta-blocker) manages how it feels while that first drug takes effect.

That same mechanism is exactly why diet timing matters directly beforehand.\n\nA low-iodine diet in the days to weeks leading up to RAI treatment is a standard part of preparation, since a thyroid already saturated with dietary iodine has less room to take up the radioactive form, blunting how well the treatment actually works.

Extending treatment to 24-36 months raises remission odds to roughly 50%, climbing further to 60% in people with smaller goiters. Specific risk factors independently lower those odds: smoking, being a young male, and having very high TSH-receptor antibody levels at diagnosis all track with remission rates falling below 20%.\n\nFor anyone who relapses after a first course, data shows a second course still carries value, a 54.1% remission rate in one cohort.

Robert Graves published his now-famous description in 1835 (palpitations, goiter, and exophthalmos, the bulging-eye sign, in three women), and the disease carries his name rather than Parry's purely because of publication timing, not who actually saw it first.\n\nEarly 20th-century treatment options were limited to surgery (initially crude: injecting hot water into the thyroid, then artery ligation, then partial removal) since neither antithyroid drugs nor radioactive iodine existed yet. The defining treatment breakthrough came in 1941, when Saul Hertz first used radioactive iodine (I-131) to treat Graves' patients, a direct outgrowth of nuclear-medicine research becoming available in that same wartime era; by 1946, radioactive iodine treatment was widely available, and remains one of the three standard treatment options (alongside antithyroid drugs and surgery) used today.",

    summary: "This is a surprising finding, relevant if pregnancy is being planned after any past Graves' treatment: TRAb (TSH-receptor antibody), the same antibody covered in the self-advocacy research, crosses the placenta and can stimulate the FETUS's thyroid independent of what the mother's current thyroid hormone level actually is. That means even a mother made hypothyroid by earlier radioactive-iodine treatment or surgery can, in documented if rare cases, still carry high enough TRAb levels to cause fetal or neonatal thyrotoxicosis.\n\nResearch finds this happens in up to 5% of pregnancies in mothers with a Graves' history, with a serious 12-20% mortality rate when it occurs, mainly from fetal heart failure. TRAb crossing becomes most consequential in the second half of pregnancy, when placental passage increases and the fetal thyroid has matured enough to actually respond to it. TRAb levels, not just the mother's TSH/T4, need monitoring throughout a pregnancy with any Graves' history, and continued fetal surveillance (heart rate, ultrasound) is recommended regardless of how low a mother's antibody titer currently reads.",

    summary: "Graves' disease carries a substantial inherited risk component, not just a loosely observed family tendency. A twin study found approximately 80% of susceptibility to Graves' disease attributable to genetic factors, with more recent estimates placing genetics at 60-80% of overall disease risk through a polygenic pattern rather than one single gene.\n\nThe best-characterized genetic contributors involve the HLA immune-recognition complex, particularly the HLA-DR3 haplotype, alongside CTLA-4 (a gene that normally acts as a brake on T-cell activation) and PTPN22, both independently studied immune-regulation genes with a documented statistical association to Graves' risk.\n\nThis connects directly to an already-established parallel: Hashimoto's heritability research draws on the same kind of twin-study and shared-gene evidence (including CTLA-4), and Graves' and Hashimoto's are themselves two opposite-direction autoimmune thyroid diseases that can run in the same families, sometimes even in the same person at different points in life. Having a close relative with Graves', or with another autoimmune thyroid condition, is a genetics-backed reason to watch for symptoms and consider a thyroid panel (covered in the self-advocacy research) earlier rather than waiting for a family history to feel coincidental.",

The structural change was substantial: proptosis (the actual forward bulging of the eye) decreased by an average of 2.46mm in the treated group versus just 0.15mm on placebo, a measurable physical reversal rather than symptom masking.\n\nLonger-term follow-up across multiple trials confirmed the benefit held up over time, including in patients re-treated after their disease returned. This is a newer and more effective option, but it isn't risk-free, research finds a higher rate of adverse events with teprotumumab than placebo, including gastrointestinal reactions, muscle spasms, and documented cases of hearing changes, worth discussing directly and thoroughly with an ophthalmologist and endocrinologist together before starting. Anyone with active, moderate-to-severe thyroid eye disease not adequately controlled by the selenium and standard measures covered elsewhere in the Graves' research has an evidence-backed reason to ask specifically about teprotumumab by name.",

    teaser: 'Research finds combining a fixed high-dose antithyroid drug with levothyroxine (block-and-replace) works about as well as the more common titrating-dose approach, with the practical benefit of fewer clinic visits and blood draws.',
    summary: "Antithyroid drug treatment for Graves' disease has two established dosing strategies, and comparative research finds them roughly equally effective at achieving a euthyroid (normal thyroid function) state, a useful thing to know when discussing treatment options with an endocrinologist. The titration regime, the more commonly used approach, involves gradually adjusting antithyroid drug dose alone based on frequent blood testing.\n\nThe block-and-replace regime instead uses a fixed, higher dose of antithyroid drug combined with levothyroxine (covered in the Hashimoto's medication research, used here for a different purpose) to prevent the person from becoming hypothyroid from the higher antithyroid dose. Research finds no statistically significant difference between the two in achieving euthyroid status, and no significant difference in the incidence of overt hypothyroidism or in rare serious side effects like agranulocytosis or liver toxicity.\n\nThe practical, everyday-life difference: block-and-replace requires measurably fewer thyroid function tests and clinic visits per year than the titration regime, a convenience advantage for someone who finds frequent blood draws and appointments burdensome. Neither approach is definitively better, both are legitimate options, and this is a worth-raising conversation with a prescriber about which regimen better fits someone's day-to-day logistics and testing tolerance, not just which one is more commonly defaulted to.",

    summary: "Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a low TSH with T4 and T3 levels still testing within the normal range, and it carries documented risks even though it hasn't progressed to the overt disease covered in depth elsewhere in the Graves' research. Pooled research finds subclinical hyperthyroidism associated with coronary heart disease, total mortality, and CHD-specific mortality.\n\nResearch finds this risk particularly pronounced at a specific threshold, a TSH at or below 0.1 mU/L carries the strongest documented association with atrial fibrillation, and research finds subclinical hyperthyroidism independently tied to increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults specifically. Research finds a bone-health cost too, decreased bone mineral density, with a documented history of hyperthyroidism (even subclinical) an independent risk factor for hip and vertebral fracture (a 1.8-fold relative risk).\n\nResearch finds emerging evidence supporting treatment specifically for TSH under 0.1 mIU/L, particularly in older adults and those at high cardiovascular or bone-fracture risk, though research also finds no long-term, definitive trial yet proving treatment itself reduces these downstream risks.

    summary: "High-dose biotin supplements carry a well-documented, and important risk of distorting the TRAb/TSI antibody testing covered in the Graves' self-advocacy research, since it can lead to a misdiagnosed case of Graves' disease that isn't actually there. Research finds biotin specifically interferes with the detection of anti-thyrotropin (TSH-receptor) antibodies, and case reports document this producing a laboratory pattern that looks identical to Graves' disease.\n\nThe underlying mechanism ties to how most commercial thyroid assays work: they rely on a biotin-streptavidin binding system, and excess biotin in the blood can either falsely lower or falsely raise a given test's result depending on the specific assay design, competitive assays (like T3/T4) tend to read falsely HIGH with excess biotin, while sandwich assays (like TSH itself) tend to read falsely LOW.\n\nCurrent American Thyroid Association guidance recommends stopping biotin supplementation for at least 2 days before any thyroid lab test, the Labs & Medication Timing category covers this same interference for Hashimoto's; it applies with equal, direct relevance here for anyone on biotin considering testing for Graves' antibodies specifically. A surprising or unexpected positive TRAb/TSI result in someone taking high-dose biotin (common in hair/skin/nail supplements) is a reason to retest after stopping the supplement before accepting the result as a Graves' diagnosis.",

    summary: "Graves' disease has three distinct first-line treatment paths, covered individually across the research (antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy), and direct, long-term comparative research finds measurable differences in outcomes between them. A large comparative study found patients treated with surgery as their initial treatment had a lower long-term risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, psychological disease, diabetes, and hypertension compared to those treated first with antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine.\n\nSeparate cost-effectiveness research found total thyroidectomy more cost-effective than radioactive iodine specifically for patients who can't tolerate or don't respond to antithyroid drugs, quality-adjusted-life-year data favoring surgery (23.6 vs. 20.9 QALYs). Research finds radioactive iodine's overall success rate variable, 60.7% in one study of young adults, with larger thyroid size and longer disease duration both identified risk factors for treatment failure requiring a second round.\n\nResearch also finds long-term, continuous antithyroid drug treatment (rather than the standard fixed-course approach) achieving substantially higher sustained remission, an alternative to the usual time-limited course. This is comparative evidence worth bringing directly into a treatment-choice conversation with an endocrinologist, no single option is universally best, and the tradeoffs (surgical risk and recovery vs. Radioactive iodine's variable success rate vs. Antithyroid drugs' relapse risk) deserve an individualized weighing rather than defaulting to whichever option is most commonly offered first.",

A separate prospective study found vitamin D deficiency was NOT associated with actually developing Graves' disease or its eye complications, and a supplementation trial found giving vitamin D didn't prevent Graves' disease from recurring after treatment.\n\nPut together, this is an association between having Graves' disease and running low on vitamin D, without solid evidence yet that the deficiency causes the disease or that correcting it changes the disease's course, the same 'correlation, unproven intervention' pattern the research has already found repeating across several other autoimmune conditions.

    teaser: 'Studies find 30-50% of patients relapse within a year of stopping antithyroid drugs, with smoking, a large goiter, and stopping treatment before 12 months all named as independent risk factors.',
    summary: "The remission-rate research names the overall numbers; more specific predictor research answers the practical follow-up question, who is actually most likely to relapse. Studies place relapse within the first year after stopping antithyroid drugs at roughly 30-40% overall, with some cohorts finding it as high as 43-50%. Independently identified predictors include smoking (the Graves'-specific smoking research, now with a second reason to matter), a large goiter, elevated thyroid hormone (FT4) at the START of treatment, stopping the drug before completing a full 12 months, and a low TSH measured just 4 weeks after stopping, a practical early-warning signal a doctor can check for directly rather than waiting to see if symptoms return.\n\nResearch has also found a genetic component (variation in immune costimulatory genes and TRAb levels) contributing to relapse risk, tied directly to the genetic/family-risk research. Relapse after stopping treatment is common enough that it should be treated as an expected possibility to actively watch for, not a sign that something went wrong with an otherwise successful first round of treatment.",

    summary: "The treatment landscape names radioactive iodine as a common first-line option for Graves' disease, and follow-up data shows exactly what it actually does to the thyroid over time. A retrospective study of 312 Graves' patients found 69.87 percent already evaluated as hypothyroid at just 6 months post-treatment, and longer-term data across multiple studies finds cumulative hypothyroidism rates ranging widely, from roughly 38.5 percent at a median 7.5 years in one cohort up to figures approaching 90 percent in others, depending on the radioactive dose used and how aggressively physicians target the thyroid.\n\nResearch finds this variation isn't random: predictive factors identified across several studies include male sex, a shorter disease duration before treatment, a smaller thyroid gland, and lower iodine uptake on pre-treatment scanning, each independently associated with becoming hypothyroid sooner.\n\nThe worth-understanding reframe: radioactive iodine isn't designed to preserve normal thyroid function while curing the overactivity, evidence finds most patients trade Graves' hyperthyroidism for a permanent need for levothyroxine replacement, covered extensively elsewhere in the Hashimoto's research. This is a known, largely intentional tradeoff of the treatment, worth discussing directly and in advance with an endocrinologist rather than treated as a surprise complication after the fact.",

      "The teprotumumab research names a structural reversal of thyroid eye disease, and dedicated follow-up research into a specific side effect deserves separate coverage. Clinical-trial data found hearing abnormalities reported by about 10 percent of patients receiving teprotumumab, with the main trial documenting specific cases: hypoacusis (reduced hearing), one case of temporary deafness, autophony (hearing an echo of one's voice), and eustachian tube dysfunction, most of which resolved. More recent, dedicated research finds these symptoms often gradual in onset, affecting both ears, persistent, and impactful on quality of life while they last, with research finding the underlying mechanism involves both inner-ear and eustachian-tube dysfunction.\n\nAn important complication: a more recent formal comparison found a similar prevalence of hearing-related complaints in Graves'/thyroid-eye-disease patients who never received teprotumumab at all, evidence that baseline hearing issues in this population make it hard to know how much of any given case is caused by the drug itself versus the underlying disease. This is worth discussing directly with a doctor before starting treatment, alongside the benefit, not a reason to avoid an effective treatment outright.",

    summary:
      "The antithyroid-drug safety research names agranulocytosis and liver injury as risks shared by both methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU), and pregnancy adds a third, different consideration specific to the developing fetus. Current guidance recommends PTU specifically during the first trimester, the most sensitive window for fetal organ development, because methimazole (and its close relative carbimazole) carries a documented risk of causing specific birth defects (embryopathy) when taken during this exact window, a risk PTU doesn't share to the same degree. The tradeoff: PTU itself carries its liver-injury risk, described elsewhere in this category as capable of coming on rapidly and unpredictably, meaning the first-trimester drug choice is a deliberate tradeoff between two different risks, not a simple 'safer drug' pick.\n\nCurrent practice guidance reflects this directly: switching from methimazole to PTU specifically upon confirming pregnancy, then often switching back to methimazole after the first trimester once the embryopathy-risk window has passed, since PTU's liver risk makes it less ideal for longer-term use. This trimester-specific switching strategy is worth confirming directly with an endocrinologist as soon as pregnancy is confirmed or being planned, since the right drug changes depending on exactly where in pregnancy someone is, not a single answer that holds throughout.",

A separate, practical finding: weight gain, a common concern once hyperthyroidism resolves, was substantially lower in the Mediterranean group (2.5kg versus 5.1kg).\n\nSeparate case-control research also finds newly diagnosed Graves' patients showing measurably different eating habits and body composition compared to matched healthy controls, before treatment even starts, suggesting diet's relevance here isn't only about managing the disease afterward.

    title: "Thyroid Eye Disease Carries a Distinct Mental-Health Burden, and Surgery Helps It",
    teaser: "The nationwide depression/anxiety finding covers Graves' disease broadly, specific data on thyroid eye disease patients finds an even wider range, and finds orbital decompression surgery measurably improving quality of life on top of the physical outcomes.",
    summary:
      "The nationwide psychiatric research names depression and anxiety as state-dependent Graves' symptoms that improve once hyperthyroidism is treated, and dedicated research on thyroid eye disease (Graves' ophthalmopathy) specifically finds its distinct psychiatric burden layered on top. Pooled data finds depression affecting 18 to 33 percent and anxiety 26 to 41 percent of thyroid eye disease patients specifically, with broader ranges (depression 9 to 70 percent, anxiety 18 to 88 percent) reported across Graves' disease patients overall, evidence of higher psychiatric burden when thyroid autoimmunity is involved compared to non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism.\n\nA useful and specific finding: depression and anxiety were significantly linked to worse quality of life in thyroid eye disease, but specific eye symptoms themselves, bulging eyes (exophthalmos) or double vision, showed no direct correlation with mood, evidence the psychiatric burden isn't simply a reaction to how the eyes look or function.\n\nThe most directly actionable finding, tying straight back to the orbital decompression research: data found surgical interventions, including decompression and eye-muscle (strabismus) surgery, improving quality of life outcomes, not just the physical measurements (proptosis, visual acuity). Mental health support is a legitimate, evidence-backed part of thyroid eye disease treatment, not a separate concern from the physical disease itself.",

    teaser: "A 500-patient retrospective study found hypothyroidism significantly tied to worse hair-loss severity, but found hyperthyroidism specifically showing no significant difference from normal thyroid function at all.",
    summary:
      "Hair thinning and shedding is a commonly reported worry among people with thyroid disease, and research finds the evidence splits by direction rather than confirming hyperthyroidism as an equal cause. A retrospective study of 500 women with telogen effluvium (a common pattern of diffuse hair shedding) found hypothyroidism, present in 30 percent of the studied patients, tied to a significantly worse hair-loss severity score than either normal thyroid function or hyperthyroidism.\n\nHyperthyroidism, present in 20.4 percent of the same study population, showed no significant difference in hair-loss severity compared to patients with entirely normal thyroid function, a clear null finding, not one to assume away. This directly means the widely-repeated assumption that an overactive thyroid itself is a major, direct driver of hair loss doesn't hold up as cleanly in data as the parallel, better-supported finding for an underactive thyroid does.\n\nFormal thyroid testing remains a reasonable, low-cost part of any hair-loss workup given how common thyroid disease is overall, but someone with well-controlled Graves' disease experiencing hair loss has reason to also look at other more directly implicated causes (nutrient deficiency, stress, medication side effects) rather than assuming the thyroid itself is automatically the driving explanation.",

    summary: "A direct comparison of leptin levels across Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and healthy controls found a striking, opposite-direction pattern between the two autoimmune thyroid diseases. In untreated Graves' (hyperthyroid), leptin ran significantly lower than in healthy controls, and rose after treatment restored normal thyroid function. This fits the broader physiology already established: hyperthyroidism raises metabolic rate and tends to reduce fat mass, and leptin, produced by fat tissue, tracks with fat mass.\n\nWorth reading alongside Hashimoto's matching leptin finding (in the mitochondria & metabolism research), the same study measured both conditions and found leptin moving in the opposite direction there, elevated rather than reduced, a direct contrast between two diseases that attack the same organ from opposite metabolic directions.",

    summary: "A 2023 study comparing thyroid tissue from people with autoimmune thyroiditis against healthy controls found disrupted expression of core clock genes, including a measurable reduction in BMAL1 and PER2, in the affected tissue. The study's patient population and mouse model centered on the gland-destroying form of autoimmune thyroiditis, the mechanism behind Hashimoto's specifically, so its direct relevance to Graves' (a stimulating rather than destructive antibody) is inferred from the shared \"autoimmune thyroiditis\" category rather than confirmed in Graves' patients themselves.\n\nWhat does transfer cleanly: circadian rhythm and thyroid autoimmunity are mechanistically linked in general, and a chronically disrupted sleep-wake and eating schedule is a plausible aggravating factor for thyroid inflammation regardless of which direction the antibody pushes hormone levels.",

      'A blinded trial took eye muscle volume, eye protrusion, lid opening, and eye pressure before and after two months of acupuncture. None of them moved.',
    summary:
      "Thyroid eye disease is one of the most distressing parts of Graves' disease and one of the hardest to treat, so it draws attention from every direction. It also has an advantage most autoimmune symptoms lack: it can be measured objectively rather than asked about. A blinded randomized study published in Acta Endocrinologica in 1991 gave 17 patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy acupuncture twice a week for two months and measured eye muscle volume, Hertel exophthalmometry for how far the eyes protrude, palpebral aperture for lid opening, intraocular pressure, and Hess chart testing for eye movement.\n\nNone of them changed significantly. Nor did the irritative conjunctival symptoms improve to a statistically significant degree. Seventeen people is small, and a small trial can miss a modest effect. But the measures here are hard numbers taken by an examiner rather than self-reports, and a therapy producing no movement in any of five objective measures is a different kind of null from one that simply has not been studied. This sits alongside a useful contrast in the sibling condition.\n\nFor Hashimoto's, a randomized controlled trial was registered in 2021 to study acupuncture specifically, and its results have not surfaced, so the answer there is pending rather than negative. Where these therapies may still earn a place in Graves' is for anxiety, sleep, and muscle tension, which are separate targets from the eyes and the thyroid.",
