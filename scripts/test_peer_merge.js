// Checks lib/peerMerge.ts, which brings two PEOPLE's copies of a shared
// thing together (2026-09-22, direct instruction: "the communication flow
// as per what is being done between the user's devices needs to be the same
// kind of process that happens between partners, and their children, and
// where applicable, their care giver").
//
// The engine underneath is the one two devices already use, and
// scripts/test_snapshot_merge.js holds that. What is checked here is the two
// things added on top of it, both of which are the allowlist:
//
//  1. Whole tables. Only what the relationship carries is sent, merged or
//     written back, and anything else that arrives is named rather than
//     quietly dropped or quietly kept.
//  2. Single columns. A note somebody wrote to themselves is stripped on the
//     way out and put back from this device on the way in, so a row taken
//     from the other side cannot blank something they were never given.
//
// Then the words: what a merge did, who did it, and what was left out.
//
// Run with: node scripts/test_peer_merge.js
// Exits non-zero on any failure.
