// One popup menu open at a time, and a tap on another hub's button while one
// is open lands on that hub rather than being swallowed.
//
// 2026-09-21, direct request, on the desktop build: "can we make it so the
// user doesn't have to click away from a menu for it to go away if for
// instance I have the TabHub menu tapped and then click on a LensHub menu."
//
// Why it needed building at all: each hub (TabHub, LensHub, MyItemsHub)
// opens a full-screen Modal whose backdrop is one Pressable covering the
// window. While it is up, the other hubs' buttons are visible underneath
// it but unreachable: a tap on one of them hits the backdrop, which closes
// the open menu, and the tap ends there. So the person taps twice, once to
// close and once to open, and the first tap looks like it did nothing.
//
// The fix keeps the Modals and puts a stand-in for every other hub's
// button inside each one, at the same window position, over the backdrop
// (components/HubHandoff.tsx renders them). A tap on a stand-in closes the
// menu it is in and opens the hub it stands for. For that, a hub has to be
// able to say where its button is and how to open it, which is what this
// registry holds: one entry per hub key, written by whichever instance is
// on the focused screen.
//
// The focus part matters. TabHub is rendered once, in the tab layout, but
// every tab screen renders its own LensHub and most render a MyItemsHub,
// and expo-router keeps every visited tab mounted. Without the focus gate
// the registry would hold whichever tab's LensHub happened to mount last,
// and a handoff from TabHub could open a menu belonging to a screen the
// person is not looking at. So a hub registers only while its screen is
// focused (useIsFocused), and unregisters the moment it is not.
//
// The stand-ins rely on one thing that the menus already rely on: a view
// placed inside the Modal with the same `bottom` and `left` a button was
// given outside it lands on the same spot. The card in each menu is placed
// exactly that way (useMenuCardBottom), and has been confirmed on-device,
// so this adds no new coordinate assumption. Where that ever failed, the
// worst case is the old behavior: the tap hits the backdrop and closes
// the menu.
//
// No React in here, so scripts/test_hub_handoff.js can check it without a
// phone. components/HubHandoff.tsx is the hook and the stand-in rendering.

// 'quick' is the quick-access menu on the thumb side (components/
// QuickAccessButton.tsx), since 1.0.66.8. It is not a Modal and lives at the
// root rather than on a screen, so it registers whenever it is mounted.
// 'study' is the flash cards and reading tab on the far side (components/
// LanguageBasicsButton.tsx), since 2026-11-12, registered the same way.
//
// 2026-11-13, direct request: "Just like the TabHub menu, and the LensHub
// menu buttons, make it so all of the small quick access menu icons are
// always active to be selected while other menus have focus. Same for the
// Updates button in the top right corner." So every edge tab registers here
// too, through components/EdgeTab.tsx itself ('hand', 'voice', 'search'), and
// so does the header's Updates button ('updates'), which is measured from
// the top of the window rather than the bottom. Their `open` is what a tap
// on the button does.
