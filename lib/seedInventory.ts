// Seed inventory (I9, 2026-10-02): the packets a person has on hand, before
// any of them goes into the ground. Each packet records the crop, the
// variety, where it came from, the year or day it was packed for, how much
// is in it and the days to maturity it gives. A planting can be sown from a
// packet, which takes the amount sown off what the packet has left, and a
// germination test ("8 of 10 sprouted") can be recorded against it.
//
// How long a crop's seed keeps comes from one published table, Colorado
// State University Extension's "Storing Vegetable and Flower Seeds", given
// as a guide in years under cool, dry storage and never as a date the seed
// stops working. Celeriac is left out because that table lists it twice,
// under 3 years and under 4. A crop the table does not name shows its age
// with no figure beside it rather than a guessed one.
//
// Nothing here grades a packet. An old packet is not called bad, a low test
// is not called poor; the sentences say what the record holds and what a
// germination test would show.
//
// Pure, no React and no database, so scripts/test_seed_inventory.js can
// check it; reading and writing are in lib/seedInventoryDb.ts.
