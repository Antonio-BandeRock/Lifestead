// Things that need doing again, and things that run out.
//
// Built 2026-09-05. Life's fourth area, chosen over the alternatives because
// the mechanism was already proven three times in the same day and because the
// documents half is load-bearing for anyone living somewhere their papers have
// to be renewed.
//
// WHY THIS DOES NOT REUSE DueRule, WHICH LOOKS LIKE THE OBVIOUS ANSWER.
//
// lib/financeSchedule.ts already models "the second Tuesday of every third
// month" for bills, and forcing upkeep through it was the first plan. It is
// wrong, and the reason is worth keeping:
//
//   A BILL is calendar-anchored. Rent arrives on the 1st whether or not you
//   did anything, so its next date comes from a rule about the calendar.
//
//   A SERVICE is last-done-anchored. A boiler serviced in March is next due
//   the following March, not next January. Its next date comes from when you
//   last did it plus how often it needs doing.
//
// Reusing the bill machinery would have quietly told someone their boiler was
// due in January because that is when the rule fired, regardless of the service
// three months earlier. Same-looking shape, different semantics.
//
// TWO SHAPES, THEREFORE.
//
//   recurring  needs doing again every so often, counted from the last time.
//              Servicing, filters, gutters, descaling.
//   expires    has one date and then it is over. A passport, a registration,
//              a warranty. Some renew and some just end, which is stored,
//              because "renew this" and "this is finished" are different
//              things to be told.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE WILL NOT DO.
//
// It never says something is required. Whether a vehicle must be inspected, or
// how long a licence lasts, depends entirely on where someone lives, and the
// app holds what they told it rather than asserting a rule. Same line
// constants/workBenefitPrompts.ts already holds, and the same correction from
// earlier the same day that produced it.
//
// It never invents a cost. An item with no cost recorded is counted and named,
// and any total built over them says how many are missing and calls itself a
// floor, which is the rule the grocery list has held since it shipped.
