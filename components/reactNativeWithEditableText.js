// React Native with Text swapped for components/EditableText.tsx, so every
// piece of text in this app can be tapped and changed while Tell Claude's
// Edit wording mode is on (1.0.51.12). metro.config.js hands this module to
// this app's own files in place of 'react-native'; libraries in
// node_modules, EditableText.tsx and this file still get React Native itself.
//
// Since 1.0.66.11 the buttons and scroll views are swapped too, for voice
// control: components/voiceNamedControl.js wraps each so it puts itself in
// lib/voiceControlRegistry.ts while mounted, and passes every prop through.
//
// Every other export is passed through as a getter, so nothing is read from
// React Native until something asks for it, the same laziness React
// Native's own index relies on.
// 'react-native/index' rather than 'react-native': see reactNativeText.js.
