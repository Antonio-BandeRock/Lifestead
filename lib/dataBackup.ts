// Local, whole-database backup & restore -- 2026-08-16, direct request
// following a real discussion of why this had to come before cloud sync
// (see CLAUDE.md's own "Named, unresolved risks" and Architecture-
// decisions sections for the fuller reasoning this grew out of).
//
// Two real design decisions worth stating plainly, since they answer the
// two real questions this feature was built in direct response to:
//
// 1. "The app isn't finished yet -- does backup have to wait, and how do
//    new things get covered later?" This whole module never hand-lists
//    which tables to back up. getRealUserTableNames() asks the LIVE
//    database itself, via SQLite's own sqlite_master, what real tables
//    exist right now -- so a table added in some future session (Sleep
//    tracking, say, once that addon gets built) is automatically included
//    the very next time someone exports, with zero code changes to this
//    file ever required. The one deliberate exception: this device's own
//    real signing/pairing key (lib/deviceIdentity.ts) was built from day
//    one to live in expo-secure-store, not SQLite -- a schema-driven
//    database export correctly, automatically leaves it out, which is a
//    real security property (a backup file that ends up in an email or a
//    Drive folder should never also hand someone the ability to
//    impersonate this device), not an oversight.
//
// 2. "Won't real multi-party cloud sync need this split by domain?" Yes --
//    the already-decided household-sharing tiers (CLAUDE.md's own
//    Architecture section) explicitly require it: a companion account only
//    ever sees the shared meal-plan/schedule/shopping domain, never the
//    personal-health domain (symptom logs, labs, meds, trial history,
//    condition scoring). One undifferentiated encrypted blob can't do
//    that. Today's export doesn't need to actually split, though, since
//    today it has exactly one real audience (the same person, on a future
//    device) -- but it's structured per real table (BackupEnvelope.tables
//    is a dictionary keyed by table name, not one flat array) specifically
//    so a future domain-partitioning pass is a real, additive step
//    ("route these table keys into file A, those into file B") rather than
//    a rewrite of this same shape.
//
// 3. "Is a plain-JSON export actually safe?" No, and this was fixed the
//    same day it was asked directly -- see lib/backupEncryption.ts. Every
//    real export from exportBackupToFile() now goes out as an
//    EncryptedBackupWire, never plain JSON, with the password chosen by
//    the person themselves and never stored anywhere the app can read it
//    back on its own. app/profile.tsx's own restore flow detects which
//    real shape a given file is (isEncryptedBackupWire vs. a bare
//    BackupEnvelope) and handles either correctly, so a genuinely older,
//    unencrypted backup already sitting on a device stays fully openable.
//
// A real, honest scope boundary, stated directly rather than glossed over:
// this backs up the DATABASE -- every real row, in every real local table
// -- but not the actual photo FILES a person's saved builder creations or
// favorites may reference (lib/mealPhotos.ts's own photo_uri columns are
// backed up as plain string paths, since they're ordinary column values,
// but the real image bytes those paths point at live on local device
// storage, outside SQLite entirely, and aren't bundled into this export).
// A restored database will show a broken/missing image wherever a photo
// once was, if the original device's own files are gone. Bundling real
// photo bytes into a portable backup is a genuine, separate scope
// decision (likely a much larger file, base64-embedded the same way a
// shared recipe's own small thumbnail already is in lib/sharing.ts) worth
// a real, deliberate follow-up, not attempted here.
//
// Follows the exact real dynamic-import discipline lib/customBackgroundImage.ts
// first established and lib/sharing.ts/lib/mealPhotos.ts/lib/isFileLinking.ts
// already reuse: nothing from expo-file-system is imported at module
// scope at all here, every actual call goes through a real
// `await import('expo-file-system')` inside the function that needs it.
//
// Real restore-from-anywhere, not just "undo my last local export": File's
// own static pickFileAsync() (confirmed directly against expo-file-
// system's real type declarations before relying on it) opens the OS's
// own native file browser -- already part of expo-file-system, a package
// already linked into this build, so this needed no new dependency and no
// new native rebuild at all, unlike almost every other native-picker
// feature this app has added. That's what makes a genuine disaster-
// recovery story (export, save the file wherever -- Drive, email to
// yourself, a USB transfer -- then, on a replacement phone, pick that same
// file back in) real today rather than a deferred next step.
