Only about 20% of circulating T3, the active thyroid hormone the body actually uses, comes directly from the thyroid gland itself.\n\nThe remaining 80% is produced by deiodinase enzymes converting T4 into T3 elsewhere in the body, and the liver's type 1 deiodinase (DIO1) is the most abundant deiodinase of them all, making the liver one of the two or three largest contributors to how much active thyroid hormone actually reaches the body's cells. A liver under metabolic stress isn't just a bystander to Hashimoto's. It's one of the organs directly responsible for finishing the job the thyroid gland only starts.",

    summary:
      "A hypothyroidism diagnosis rarely comes with a warning about the liver. It probably should. Thyroid hormone directly regulates the structural integrity of liver cell membranes. In hypothyroidism, altered membrane lipid composition and reduced sodium-potassium pump activity make liver cells measurably \"leakier,\" allowing liver enzymes (ALT, AST) to escape into the bloodstream even without cell death taking place.\n\nA second, separate mechanism compounds it: reduced hepatic blood flow creates a mild, chronic oxygen-deprived state in the liver, adding cellular stress on top of the membrane effect. Both mechanisms are reversible. Correcting the underlying hypothyroidism with appropriate levothyroxine therapy normalizes liver enzymes in the large majority of patients within 3-6 months. Damage, in this specific case, isn't the same thing as permanent damage.",

      "The prior entry notes hypothyroid \"brain fog\" isn't fully mapped mechanistically yet. One specific, directly demonstrated piece of that mechanism does exist, covered here as a separate entry rather than folded into the broader, more general Health Literacy neurogenesis topic, since this connection is specific enough to Hashimoto's core mechanism (hypothyroidism) to deserve direct coverage.\n\nA study found that inducing hypothyroidism in adult rats reduced hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation by roughly 30 percent, along with a decline in the number of young, developing neurons and reduced complexity of their connections, changes that directly correlated with a measurable depressive-like behavior in the same animals. The encouraging, practical part of this finding: this reduction is fully reversible, restoring normal thyroid hormone levels reverses the reduced proliferation back toward normal.\n\nThe actual molecular mechanism has since been worked out in detail: active thyroid hormone (T3) functions as what researchers describe as a \"neurogenic switch,\" directly suppressing specific genes (Sox2, CyclinD1, c-Myc) that keep neural stem cells in a dividing, undifferentiated state, pushing them instead toward becoming mature, functioning neurons. This gives hypothyroid \"brain fog\" a specific, reversible biological mechanism, not just a vague, unmeasurable complaint, and it's a direct, concrete reason consistent thyroid management matters for more than lab numbers alone.",
