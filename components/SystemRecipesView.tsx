// The curated recipes, on the Food tab, grouped under the builder that
// makes them. Direct instruction, 2026-09-18: "I would like the System
// recipes from Digest to move to Food on the Food page and be access from
// System Meals, but change System Meals to System Recipes. When I select
// System Recipes, the recipes should be listed by the Builder that would
// create them or would be used to edit them if the user wanted to start
// with a system recipes and change it to suit their liking... When the
// user selects a meal, side, smoothie, etc from the drop down collapsable
// card, it expands to show everything it would have shown from when it was
// listed in Digest. The recipe, the measurements, the prepwork,
// everything."
//
// So the shape is My Recipes' shape (components/FoodItemsView.tsx): one
// fold band per builder, an inset row per recipe, and the row opens in
// place rather than navigating anywhere. What opens is the same
// RecipeDetailCard the Digest renders, painted in Food's green rather
// than the Digest's purple, so the two can never drift apart.
//
// 1.0.40.10, direct instruction: "make sure to provide the filter for diet
// type that was available in Digest, as well as a search utility just as it
// was in Digest too. Put a one pixel separation line mid way between
// recipes in each category. Also, I think maybe the Sides should be
// separated by sub groups based on the type of side it is." All four are
// below. The search box is the same component the Digest uses, moved out to
// components/EntrySearchInput.tsx rather than copied, and a search shows a
// flat ranked result list the way the Digest's does instead of asking
// somebody to open eleven folds looking for the hit.
//
// No data plumbing of its own: every curated recipe already carries its
// full recipeCard, its linkedBuilderType and its linkedCuratedRecipeId in
// the JS bundle (lib/digest/recipes.ts), so this reads them straight out
// rather than going near either database.

const TAB_COLOR = colors.tabFood;

// The bands, in the order Food's lens list puts the builders, with the
// icon each builder already uses.
//
// Ten of the eleven bands are one builder each. The Side Builder is the
// exception and splits in two, because it is this app's generic
// single-dish tool: a roasted salmon fillet and a bowl of sauteed spinach
// were both authored through it, so grouping purely by builder put 126
// dishes that ARE the meal under a heading that says they sit beside one.
// Direct instruction, 1.0.41.1: "Move the 91 mains out of Sides into their
// own group." Which of the two a recipe belongs to is decided by
// lib/recipeDishRole.ts, and Build This Recipe still opens the Side
// Builder from either band, since that is the tool that edits them both.
//
// There is no Meals group, and it is not an omission: a curated recipe's
// linkedBuilderType is a BuilderFavoriteItemType (lib/db.ts), which has no
// 'meal' in it, because Meal Builder assembles a meal out of saved
// components rather than holding ingredients of its own. So a system meal
// cannot exist in the corpus today, and adding one would mean widening
// that type first, then authoring meals as combinations of the components
// below. Raised with the owner 2026-09-18.
//
// 2026-10-29: Mexican is a band of its own, the one band that is a cuisine
// rather than a builder, because its dishes are built from each other
// (tortillas, salsas, moles) and read best kept together, shelved by
// MEXICAN_SHELVES below. Each still opens the builder it was written for.
