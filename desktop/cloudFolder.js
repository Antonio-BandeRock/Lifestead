// The shared folder on a computer: a folder on the disk that OneDrive
// keeps in step with the cloud, read and written like any other folder.
//
// On a phone the app reaches OneDrive through Microsoft Graph, with a
// sign-in of its own, because Android's OneDrive provider will not let an
// app pick a folder (lib/oneDriveAuth.ts has the whole account). On a
// computer none of that is needed: the OneDrive client is already signed
// in, already syncing, and the folder it keeps is right there on the disk
// (C:\Users\<name>\OneDrive on Windows, ~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-*
// on a Mac). So lib/desktop/cloudFolder.ts answers every call
// lib/oneDriveGraph.ts would have sent to Graph from here instead, and
// the OneDrive client carries the bytes. No sign-in, no token, no
// redirect that had nowhere to land (the 2026-09-21 report: the sign-in
// "kept waiting and waiting and never completed", because the redirect
// goes to hashimotosapp://, which nothing on a PC is registered for).
//
// A folder is addressed by its absolute path, which is what the app
// stores as the itemId of a DriveItemRef whose driveId is 'disk'.
//
// WRITES ARE CONFINED. Reads go anywhere, since a folder the person picked
// can be anywhere. Writes, deletes and moves are allowed inside a detected
// cloud root, inside the person's home folder (which is where every
// sync client keeps its folder), and inside any folder picked through the
// dialog in this run. The app only ever writes inside the one folder that
// was chosen, and this is the line that keeps a mistake in the app from
// reaching the rest of the disk.
//
// A FILE IS WRITTEN WHOLE. A mailbox file or a backup is written to a
// temporary name beside its final one and renamed into place, so the
// OneDrive client never uploads a half-written file: it sees the old one,
// then the new one, never something in between.
