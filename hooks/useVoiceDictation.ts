// A real, shared wrapper around expo-speech-recognition, built 2026-08-16
// alongside the whole voice-input feature. Every mic button in this app
// (search boxes, dictated notes) goes through this one hook rather than
// each screen touching the native module directly -- see
// components/VoiceInputButton.tsx for the actual UI that calls this.
//
// A real, non-obvious correctness detail worth keeping in mind: the
// native speech-recognition module only ever supports one active
// listening session at a time, and useSpeechRecognitionEvent subscribes
// to that SAME global native event stream regardless of which component
// calls it -- there's no per-instance scoping on the native side. If two
// of these hooks were ever mounted and "listening" at once (which can't
// actually happen, since starting a second session while one is already
// active isn't a real supported state), a naive implementation could let
// one component's callbacks fire for a session another component
// started. isActiveRef below is what actually guards against that: every
// event handler checks it before calling the caller's own callbacks, so
// a hook instance that never called start() (or already stopped) simply
// stays silent no matter what the global native stream reports.
