// Choosing the one Shared Folder everything the app keeps in OneDrive lives in.
//
// ONE FOLDER, NOT TWO. An earlier pass asked for a mailbox folder and a backup
// folder to be picked separately, which put the person in charge of a layout the
// app should keep itself. Now one folder is chosen and the app makes and owns
// what goes inside it:
//
//   Shared Folder
//   |- Mailbox     where every person's mailbox lives, partner and later child
//   |- Backups     where backups are written
//
// SET UP BEFORE ANYBODY IS ADDED. This is not a step that belongs to pairing. It
// is set up when the app is first opened, whether or not there is ever a partner,
// because backups need it just as much as a mailbox does.
//
// A REAL PICKER, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT. An earlier attempt asked somebody to
// type a folder's name, which told the app nothing it could open. This browses
// the actual account and hands back an address the app can write to and read
// from.
//
// TWO STARTING POINTS, AND BOTH ARE NEEDED. A folder somebody else shared with
// you does not appear anywhere in your own OneDrive; it sits under Shared with me
// and physically lives in their drive. Whoever MADE the folder finds it under
// their own files instead.
//
// ON A COMPUTER THERE IS NO SIGN-IN AND ONE STARTING POINT. The OneDrive
// client on the machine is already signed in and keeps its folder on the
// disk, so the picker starts inside that folder (lib/desktop/cloudFolder.ts
// finds it), a shared folder is whatever the person added to their own
// OneDrive, and the operating system's folder dialog is offered beside the
// listing for anyone who would rather point at the folder directly. The
// sign-in and sign-out cards are not shown, because there is nothing to sign
// in to: the 2026-09-21 report was a sign-in page that "kept waiting and
// waiting and never completed", since Microsoft's redirect had nowhere to
// land on a PC.
