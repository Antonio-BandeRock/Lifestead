// Autism, ADHD and dyslexia, listed the way food allergies are listed, and
// what each one switches on.
//
// 2026-09-17, direct instruction: "The two, Autism, and ADHD can be listed
// in the profile the same way that food alergies are listed, and even
// Dyslexia could be listed there too, and they then trigger the additional
// settings for them and the app can use those as triggers to turn on the
// specific things for them... Not as tracked conditions."
//
// WHY NOT A TRACKED CONDITION. The 19 tracked conditions drive food
// scoring: declaring one changes what the app says about an ingredient,
// because there is cited evidence tying that food to that condition. None
// of the three here works that way. The evidence does not support diet
// treating autism, ADHD or dyslexia, and wiring them into the scoring
// engine would say that it does. See lib/digest/neurodivergence.ts for the
// research this rests on, including the trials that came back null.
//
// So what these three DO is turn on settings. Every one of those settings
// already exists and is already reachable by hand in Profile. Nothing here
// is gated behind a declaration, nothing is hidden from anybody who does
// not declare, and nothing is switched on without being shown first. What
// the declaration saves is the finding: somebody who needs a quieter Home,
// a place to throw a thought, and a reminder that speaks before a thing
// rather than at it would otherwise have to know all three settings
// existed and find them in three different places.
//
// The list is deliberately short. These three were asked for by name.
// Anything added later has to clear the same bar: it changes which
// SETTINGS make sense, not which foods are safe.
//
// PURE. No database, no React, no colours, no runtime imports, so
// scripts/test_neuroProfile.js can run it in plain node.

// The reminder kinds these can switch on. Type-only, so this file stays
// import-free at runtime; tsc still keeps the two in step, so a renamed
// kind over in reminderPreferences breaks here rather than silently
// pointing at nothing.
