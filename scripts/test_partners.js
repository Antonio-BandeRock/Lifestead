// Runs lib/partners.ts: two people, two phones, one dinner.
//
// Built 2026-09-06. The risks, in order:
//
//  1. THE EXCLUSION RULE IS THE WHOLE FEATURE. A meal is out if it is RED for
//     anyone, and kept with a note if it is only yellow. Getting this wrong in
//     either direction is the two failure modes: intersecting on yellow empties
//     the menu, and not excluding on red plans a dinner that is actively bad for
//     one of them.
//  2. 'unknown' must NOT exclude. It is the opposite of what the single-person
//     generator does, deliberately, and it is the difference between a coverage
//     gap and an empty screen.
//  3. Nothing is combined until the partner has actually shared, and each refusal
//     names which piece is missing rather than falling back silently.
//  4. Condition codes and nothing else. No symptom, lab, stage or note vocabulary
//     may appear anywhere in this module's text.
//  5. The merged array must be stable, since the generator caches pools by it.
//
// Run with: node scripts/test_partners.js
// Exits non-zero on any failure.
