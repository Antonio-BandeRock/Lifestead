// Checks how lib/reminderNotifications.ts decides a pending reminder is still
// right (2026-09-28). Every body ends with an "as of" stamp carrying the
// minute the reconcile ran, and comparing whole bodies rescheduled every
// reminder at each app open or close, which showed as lag between screens.
//
// The rules checked:
//
//  1. withoutFreshness takes out each stamp shape the module writes: a time
//     alone, and a month, day and time.
//  2. Two bodies that differ only in the stamp compare equal; a body whose
//     other wording changed does not.
//  3. The reconcile compares through withoutFreshness.
//  4. A call made during a run queues one more run rather than sharing the
//     run already going.
//
// Run with: node scripts/test_reminder_freshness_compare.js
// Exits non-zero on any failure.
