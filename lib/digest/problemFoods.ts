// Problem Foods & Swaps -- the one genuinely new content type this session
// built, not carried over from an earlier research document. Practical and
// food-first rather than citation-review-shaped: name the problem, name
// the mechanism, then give concrete substitutes -- "teach them about the
// food in general," per the explicit request that prompted this whole
// category. Every entry still cites its evidence, but the swap list is the
// point, not a footnote.
//
// 2026-08-06: rewritten in a friendlier, plainer-language voice, and grown
// by 2 entries (excess iodine, charred/high-heat meat) -- direct feedback
// that the first pass read as dense/academic ("not written for the
// average person... isn't really all that fun") and that stating a fixed
// entry count elsewhere in this app's own docs made every category read
// as artificially capped rather than a living, growing thing. The
// underlying facts and every citation are unchanged in substance from the
// first pass (re-verified against real sources, not just reworded) --
// only the voice and the roster grew. This file's own comment intentionally
// does not restate a running entry count, for the same reason.
//
// 2026-08-08: content fields rewritten a second time to remove AI-writing
// tics flagged directly by the person -- em dashes as punctuation, "not X,
// it's Y" contrast, and overused words like "real"/"genuinely"/
// "honest(ly)"/"worth" -- see bigPicture.ts's own header comment for the
// full context. Every fact, number, and citation is unchanged; the
// friendly, plain-language voice from the 2026-08-06 pass is preserved.
//
// 2026-08-08, same day, third change: `category` reassigned per entry as
// part of the Digest-wide Hashimoto's/Basic Health restructure (see
// types.ts's own header comment). ProblemFoodEntry's own `category` field
// was widened from the old hardcoded literal 'problemFoods' to the same
// union DigestEntry uses -- see types.ts for how the two shapes are told
// apart now that `category` can't serve as the discriminant. 9 of 16
// entries route through a specific thyroid or autoimmune mechanism
// (gluten's zonulin pathway framed for Hashimoto's specifically, raw
// goitrogenic crucifers' iodine-uptake interference, sugar's cortisol-to-
// T4/T3-conversion route, soy's TPO-enzyme interference, coffee's own
// levothyroxine-absorption timing, kelp/iodine's Wolff-Chaikoff mechanism,
// the gluten-free-without-celiac antibody finding, and, corrected the same
// day, nightshades' own AIP/autoimmune-elimination-diet framing and high-
// histamine's own autoimmune-gut-trouble mechanism) and now carry
// `category: 'hashimotos'`. The other 7, genuinely condition-agnostic
// (garlic/onion FODMAPs, dairy's lactose/casein mechanisms, refined oils,
// commercial/pre-made products, pesticide residue, charred/grilled meat,
// and the closing synthesis) carry `category: 'basicHealth'`.

    mechanism:
      "Four named pathogens do most of the damage: Salmonella (a leading overall cause, especially tied to poultry and eggs), Campylobacter (tied to undercooked poultry), E. coli, and Listeria (fewer cases overall, but disproportionately severe, especially for pregnant people, older adults, and anyone with a weakened immune system, including several conditions this app tracks that involve biologics, methotrexate, or other immunosuppressive treatment).\n\nGround meat carries a higher risk than a whole cut of the same animal: grinding mixes any surface bacteria throughout the whole batch, so a rare burger can carry bacteria all the way through in a way a rare steak, where bacteria mostly sit on the surface a hot pan already sears, does not. Raw fish has its separate safety standard: the FDA requires fish served raw to first be frozen (-4°F for 7 days, or -31°F until solid then held at -31°F for 15 hours) to kill parasites like Anisakis. \"Sushi-grade\" is not an official grading term, it is shorthand for fish that has gone through this process.",

This is a different, more specific question: does actually removing gluten measurably change Hashimoto's antibody levels or thyroid numbers in someone without celiac disease? A very recent (2025) systematic review and meta-analysis pooling 3 randomized trials (110 participants) found a surprising, mixed answer, not the clean \"yes, it helps\" most gluten-free advice for Hashimoto's assumes.",
    mechanism: "The numbers went in two directions: going gluten-free significantly decreased anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, but significantly increased anti-TPO antibodies, moving in opposite directions on the two core antibody markers the tracking is built around. TSH, free T3, and free T4 showed no significant change either way. The review's authors rated the underlying evidence as having \"serious methodological concerns\" and being \"very uncertain,\" an admission from the researchers themselves, not a hedge added here.\n\nNone of this changes the separate case for a true celiac disease diagnosis, where gluten-free eating is medically necessary regardless of any thyroid-specific effect. This is specifically about the much more common situation of choosing to go gluten-free for the Hashimoto's itself, without a celiac diagnosis driving it.",
