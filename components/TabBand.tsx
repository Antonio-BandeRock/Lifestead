// The band shapes every tab's lenses are built from, 2026-09-19.
//
// Direct instruction, after Conditions took the edge-to-edge look: "the
// full screen width and new formatting for everything is needed wherever
// it isn't already in place." Life's lenses took it first (as LifeBand,
// renamed the same day once Reports and Trends needed the same shapes),
// and every tab converted since stacks the same three, so they live here
// once rather than as a copy in each screen:
//
// 1. TabBand: a fold. One row carrying a name (and a count), opening on
//    tap to its rows, with the open state remembered per band through
//    useBandFolds. My Meds was the first Life lens to take it, 2026-09-13.
// 2. box: a band that is not a fold (an intro, a form, an empty notice).
//    Same edges, its own content inset, nothing to tap on the row.
// 3. heading: a one-row band introducing a group of boxes that are not
//    inside a fold, on the muted surface so it reads as a label.
//
// A converted screen's scroll content has no side inset any more
// (app/(tabs)/life.tsx was first), so a band reaches the edge by default;
// nothing here cancels a margin. Anything that has to sit between bands
// without being one (a pill row, a lone button) takes `inset` instead.
