// Recording what happened to extra harvest, and moving the goods.
//
// Added 2026-09-05. Same split every other module here follows: the
// arithmetic and the honesty rules live in lib/harvestTrade.ts with no
// database, and this does the reading and writing.
//
// The one thing worth knowing before changing anything: a disposition is
// THREE moves at once, and they have to happen together or the record and the
// inventory disagree.
//
//   1. The harvest comes down, through the same consumeKitchenItem that
//      cooking already uses, so a harvest drawn down by trading and one drawn
//      down by eating go through one path.
//   2. For a trade, each thing received becomes a kitchen row, sourced
//      'trade' so the inventory can say how it got there.
//   3. For a sale, an income entry is written, tagged to a stream if one was
//      picked, so selling surplus reaches the income figures instead of
//      sitting in its own corner.
