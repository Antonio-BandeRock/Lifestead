// Pediatric Nutrition -- new 2026-08-09, a real, direct response to a gap
// named in the same day's "what's missing" conversation: every RDA/AI
// figure across this app's own Portions & Recommended Amounts and
// Essential Nutrients research is adult-only (19+). Confirmed directly
// before writing anything: the bundled reference database's own
// `dietary_reference_intakes` table (the exact source Portions & RDA reuses
// for adult figures) carries zero rows with age_min under 19 -- pediatric
// nutrient needs are a genuine, real content gap in this app today, not
// something already covered elsewhere and just unindexed.
//
// Deliberately scoped as real, cited Digest CONTENT, not a new functional
// DRI-tracking feature -- this app's own Insights/DRI-percentage tracking
// stays adult-scoped for now; building real child-specific tracking (a
// separate age-band selection, a real UI for it) is a genuinely larger,
// separate engineering task than adding the research itself, named
// directly rather than implied as already built. Every claim independently
// verified via WebSearch before being written in.

    teaser: 'Growth itself changes what a body needs, some nutrients matter MORE per pound of body weight in childhood than they ever will again.',
    summary: "Every RDA/AI figure cited elsewhere (Portions & Recommended Amounts, Essential Nutrients) is built for adults age 19 and up, separate DRI tables exist for infants, children, and adolescents, and they don't simply scale an adult figure down by body weight.\n\nA growing body has distinct nutrient priorities an adult body doesn't: building new bone mass at a rate that will never happen again after the teenage years, building brain structure at a pace concentrated almost entirely in the first several years of life, and (for many adolescent girls) managing a new, recurring blood loss that didn't exist before puberty. These entries cover the specific windows where getting a nutrient right (or wrong) in childhood has a documented, lasting effect.",

    teaser: 'Calcium\'s target more than doubles between age 4 and age 9, a deliberate jump timed to a growth window, not a gradual ramp.',
    summary:
      "Official NASEM figures show calcium's RDA climbing from 500 milligrams a day at ages 1 to 3, to 800 milligrams at 4 to 8, to 1,300 milligrams at 9 to 18, the highest calcium requirement at any point across an entire human lifespan, timed specifically to the adolescent bone-building window.\n\nIron follows a similarly sharp jump: 7 milligrams a day at 4 to 8, rising to 8 at 9 to 13, then spiking specifically for adolescent girls to 15 milligrams a day once menstruation typically begins, a direct reflection of new blood loss that didn't exist at the earlier age band. These aren't smooth, gradual increases scaled to body size, they're deliberate jumps timed to specific, developmental events, which is exactly why \"just give a child a smaller adult multivitamin\" misses the actual target for several key nutrients.",

    summary:
      "Published research finds iron deficiency anemia affecting 9 to 11 percent of adolescent girls globally, with regional studies finding rates as high as 21.5 percent in Jordan and 47.9 percent in one Pakistani population, a common, not-rare condition specifically in this age group. The mechanism is direct: menstrual blood loss adds a new iron demand on top of the same growth-driven iron need already increasing at this age, and research finds this combination pushes many adolescent girls' actual intake below their elevated 15 milligram-a-day target.\n\nDocumented symptoms (fatigue, difficulty concentrating, pale skin) can be easy to attribute to normal teenage tiredness or a demanding school schedule rather than the correctable nutrient issue underneath, worth a conversation with a pediatrician specifically once menstruation has started, not assumed away as ordinary adolescence.",

    summary: "Published bone-density research finds roughly 90 percent of a person's lifetime peak bone mass is already built by around age 18 in women and age 20 in men, with adolescence alone contributing as much as half of total adult bone mass, a time-limited window, not something that can be fully made up for later in life the same way.\n\nCalcium and vitamin D are the two most directly load-bearing nutrients for this process, and current research finds an ongoing concern that many adolescents fall short of both. This isn't abstract long-term risk, bone density built (or not built) during these specific years is one of the strongest known predictors of osteoporosis and fracture risk decades later, the same osteoporosis risk the adult research (RA, Celiac, and several other conditions) covers as a downstream consequence.",

    summary: "Research on choline and DHA (a specific omega-3 fatty acid concentrated in brain and eye tissue) consistently frames their strongest developmental effect around \"the first 1,000 days,\" the specific span from conception through roughly age 2, with continued relevance to synapse formation up through age 6 or 7.\n\nThe already-existing Choline research covers adult liver/cardiovascular findings in depth, this entry names the separate, earlier-life story: choline is a building block for the phospholipids that make up brain-cell membranes and for acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, while DHA directly supports neuron and retinal development, with reduced DHA levels linked in research to impaired neuron growth. Both nutrients matter well before the broader tracking scope typically applies (pregnancy and early infancy), a reason this specific window deserves a separate mention rather than folding quietly into general \"eat healthy\" advice.",

    summary:
      "A child's lower body weight means the exact same milligram or microgram dose of a vitamin or mineral represents a proportionally larger amount per pound of body weight than it would for an adult, a direct, mechanical reason \"just give a smaller dose\" matters. The higher-risk nutrients are the fat-soluble ones (A, D, E, K), which the body stores rather than excretes the way it does water-soluble B vitamins and vitamin C, a documented case report describes a 3-year-old with incidental high-dose vitamin D toxicity from exactly this mechanism.\n\nA separate, well-documented problem compounds this: candy-flavored gummy vitamins increase accidental-ingestion risk in young children specifically because they taste like a treat rather than a medicine, with poison-control data finding two-thirds of supplement-related poisoning inquiries involve exactly this kind of accidental ingestion by a young child.",

    summary: 'Good pediatric nutrition is several distinct windows, each with a different timing and a different most-relevant nutrient: bone-building peaks in adolescence, brain-building concentrates overwhelmingly in the first several years of life, and iron need spikes specifically once menstruation begins, not at a fixed age.
