// Which bands on a screen are open, remembered across launches, 2026-09-13.
//
// Home's own sections have folded to one row since 2026-09-12, with the
// open/closed state kept in visual preferences so what someone leaves open
// stays open. Schedules is the first tab whose lenses take the same fold
// ("Everything folds", every band closed until tapped), and the same rule
// has to hold there: a day's meal list folded shut on every visit would
// cost a tap each time. So the state persists per band, keyed by a string
// each screen chooses ("schedule:meals:day"), absence meaning folded, the
// contract homeSectionExpanded already set, with the short list of
// exceptions in BANDS_OPEN_UNTIL_CLOSED reading the other way.
//
// One hook per screen. It loads once, answers synchronously from then on,
// and writes through setVisualPreferences on every toggle, the same as
// Home's own handler. Until the load lands every band reads as whatever it
// starts as, which is where it would have landed anyway, so nothing springs
// open and shut.
