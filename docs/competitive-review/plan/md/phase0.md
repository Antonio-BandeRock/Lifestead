### P2. A small beta outside the house
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** none
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Five to ten people (two with one of the 19 conditions, two with ADHD, a gardener, a caregiver) for two to four weeks on the Play internal testing track, then a conversation with each. Plus a private, opt-in usage summary the person sends themselves, nothing leaving the phone otherwise. The first named risk says to test logging before building around it.

### P3. Redraw the tier table and plan how tiers are checked
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** all
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** One pass over every tab and lens, Free or paid, under the 2026-10-06 rule (Free stays a little useful, paying brings big wins); the Free row predates Life, Garden, Your Story, App Lock, Interests and Learn and leaves the second audience nowhere. Then one module that answers "is this available", read by every gated screen, built early even if it says yes to everything until launch.

### P5. If something happens to me: keeping a life's records reachable
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Life,Profile
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** No forgot-password flow, encrypted backups and App Lock mean a family loses everything on death or incapacity. Design, while the person is well: a recovery key handed to a named person in advance (printed, or sealed to their key through Connections), a sealed letter, and plainly what that person can open. No company server. Build follows in phase 3. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f2728137b703ec99f422084f

### P14. Conversions, a lens of tools people actually need
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** Life
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Index and rules for P15 to P21: every answer shows the arithmetic and why the measures differ; never across kinds unless the thing supplies the link (a food's density, a substance's molar mass), unknown said as unknown; offline, nothing sent; health conversions never interpret or suggest a dose; answers can be saved into a record; a Convert button beside number fields elsewhere. Decided 2026-10-06: a lens on Life. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f27281d599c9e908f66f60a7

### P28. Safety is never behind a paywall
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** all
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Confirmed 2026-10-06 by direct instruction ("Confirm P28 as written"), and the CLAUDE.md tier table changed with it: the emergency card, med and supplement timing warnings from the interaction rules, allergy cautions and the clinical-claims protections are on every tier including Free. The current tier table puts the rules engine on paid only. Free useful on its own; paying adds depth, people and time saved. The vault (agreed the same day) keeps these outside it as well.

### P34. Separate versions of the app, side by side on one page
- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** all
- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Asked of you: these meet a standing rule or need a company server
- **How:** Asked 2026-10-12, after the Leaguestead version page: one private clickable page that opens on a version picker (Free, Individual, Partner, a Household seat, a Guardian child, a Caregiver, and the first run with and without a condition), each version kept in its own screens with a bar at the top to come back, each starting from a ready scenario, and each revision numbered. Tony goes through them and lists what has to change, be removed, reworded, updated or added, so what belongs in each version is there and what does not belong is not. Reads its tab and lens lists from lib/paidFeatures.ts and constants/tabs.ts so it cannot drift from the app. Ties to P3 and P27. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f753652f27281c6a5fdc791ae35294f

### U1. The billing floor
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** Noom, Inflow, Goblin.tools, Headway, PictureThis, Paired · **Theme:** What competitors' users complain about (2026-10-09)
- **How:** No free trial that turns into a charge unnoticed: renewal accepted by a box ticked on purpose, a reminder two days before any first or renewing charge, a receipt for every charge, and cancelling in one step inside the app. Decided with P27 before any price ships. Sources: complaints/home.md, across.md, garden.md, companions.md. Decided 2026-10-09: yes.

### U2. Nothing already used moves behind payment
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** Quizlet, Trello, Drafts, Forest, 11pets, Obsidian Sync, Google One · **Theme:** What competitors' users complain about (2026-10-09)
- **How:** A function a person has used on a tier stays on that tier, a price is never raised on the same thing for an existing subscriber, a limit is never enforced by making the person's own records read only, and nothing is priced per animal, hive, deck or project. Decided with the free/paid board and Z15. Sources: complaints/interests.md, home.md, garden.md, across.md. Decided 2026-10-09: no, as written. A paid function turns off when the free trial ends, and the trial is 60 days, long enough for Pattern Finder and Trends to have weeks of records to show. What stays: nothing the person recorded is lost, and the wall says so.

### U3. Say what is Free before setup, and open on the person's own things
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** PictureThis, RHS Grow, Goblin.tools, Veglog · **Theme:** What competitors' users complain about (2026-10-09)
- **How:** No offer screen on opening the app or a tab; what is Free and what is paid is said in the store listing and before the first question of setup, never after it. Sources: complaints/garden.md, home.md. Decided 2026-10-09: yes. Built 1.0.68.5: the Free line sits at the top of the first interview question while it is unanswered and nowhere else (FREE_BEFORE_SETUP in lib/yourStoryInterview.ts); the store listing half waits for the listing.

### U4. Privacy is never what a person pays for
- **Ships by:** Owner decision first · **Size:** S · **Tabs:** All
- **Answers:** Keepsafe, Standard Notes · **Theme:** What competitors' users complain about (2026-10-09)
- **How:** App Lock and the vault sit on Free beside safety (P28), with no ads or trackers on any tier. A placement to confirm on the free/paid board. Source: complaints/across.md. Decided 2026-10-09: yes, x-lock and x-vault pinned to Free on the board.
