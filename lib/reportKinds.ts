// The seven reports marked Build on the inputs-to-outputs map (1.0.52.7),
// each a different reader's view over the same records the Overview reads.
// This file holds what each report is and how a finished reading turns
// into report sections, with no I/O, so scripts/test_output_lenses.js can
// run it without a phone. lib/reportGenerator.ts gathers the records.
//
// Most of what these reports say is already said by a Trends or Insights
// lens, so a report section is built from that lens's ReadingView rather
// than worded a second time: the sentence a clinician reads is the one the
// person saw on screen, and the forbidden-words sweep covers both at once.
