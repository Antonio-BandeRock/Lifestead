//
// Replaced 2026-07-25: this used to be a light "Sage & Cream" theme (cream
// background, white cards, sage-green primary). It's now sourced directly
// from the commissioned thyroid-butterfly artwork -- real pixels sampled
// from the illustration, clustered into distinct jewel tones, not invented.
// Deep Navy (from the wings) replaces the old cream as the base; the warm
// gold, sage, turquoise, slate, teal, and rose tones below all come from the
// same source image. This is a deliberate, requested app-wide re-theme, not
// an incremental tweak -- every screen that reads from this file changes
// look as a result.
import { getGroundThemeSync } from '../lib/visualPreferences';

// Ground themes -- 2026-08-19, the Profile-area picker letting someone
// replace the whole navy/teal/etc. "ground" family (background, surface,
// surfaceMuted, border, textMuted, keySurface) at once, rather than editing
// this file by hand every time. Built the same day Deep Navy was actually
// replaced with Deep Teal as the shipped default (see `background`'s own
// comment below for that full story) -- the direct request that followed
// immediately after confirming Teal on-device: "add several additional
// colors... about the same darkness as this one [and] put them in the
// Profile area."
//
// Every family below (Teal included) is generated at the exact same
// relative saturation/lightness offsets from its own background that the
// original Navy family's real, individually-verified values measured out
// to -- surface: S-9/L+10, surfaceMuted: S-1/L+7, border: S-9/L+22,
// textMuted: S-8/L+38, keySurface: S+5/L+38 (all measured from Navy's own
// real shipped hex values, not guessed) -- so a new theme's internal
// contrast relationships start from the same place Navy's own
// individually-tuned ones did, rather than each needing its own from-
// scratch verification pass. Burgundy's own saturation (40 vs the 30-32 the
// others share) is one deliberate exception -- red hues read as muddy brown
// at this same darkness/saturation everyone else uses; same "same color
// family, stronger version" fix already proven repeatedly on the tab-
// identity colors below (see e.g. tabSchedules' own comment).
//
// primary/accent/textPrimary/textOnPrimary/status colors/tab-identity
// colors are NOT part of any ground theme -- scoped deliberately to the
// neutral "ground" family only, matching the original request.
//
// menuSurface is also deliberately excluded -- see its own comment below:
// it's intentionally desaturated toward neutral specifically so it doesn't
// compete with whichever hue is active, and that reasoning holds regardless
// of which ground theme is selected.

  // enough of the image shows through at rest to feel like a real
  // "sitting over the scene" card rather than a solid box, while staying
  // dark enough for body text on top to stay readable without leaning on
  // textShadow everywhere.
  // Requested again, same day: another +10 points (0.85 -> 0.95) -- this is
  // the shared token, so the bump applies to every card/table/form
  // background across the whole app (not just the 6 main tab pages), since
  // they all read from this one value.
  // Reversed, same day, on seeing it on-device: 0.95 read as too solid --
  // explicitly asked for the *background* to actually show through the
  // card, not just barely. Dropped to 0.2 (target range given was "15 or
  // 20%"), a real swing back past the original 0.85 starting point rather
  // than a small correction -- this is a deliberate "translucent enough to
  // see the scene behind it" card now, leaning on textShadow (see
  // constants/typography.ts) to keep body text legible over a much more
  // visible photo.
  // Nudged back up +10 points, same day (0.2 -> 0.3): 0.2 read as a little
  // too transparent once seen on-device.
  // Nudged again, same day: another +15 points (0.3 -> 0.45) -- still a
  // little too see-through at 0.3. Covers every "text box"/"menu box" that
  // reads this shared token (LensHub's own popup cards among them; TabHub's
  // separate menuSurface token is deliberately NOT part of this -- see its
  // own comment for why that one stays flat/opaque).
  // A bigger jump this time, same day (0.45 -> 0.65): confirmed via an
  // actual on-device screenshot that 0.45 genuinely was rendering (a fresh
  // bundle, not a stale one) -- it just wasn't a visually distinct enough
  // step from 0.3 to read as "less transparent" at these low opacity
  // levels. This is a real swing toward reading as a solid card with the
  // photo as a tint underneath, not just a modest nudge like the last two.
  // One more small nudge, same day (0.65 -> 0.75) -- confirmed as a good
  // landing point via an on-device screenshot, then asked for a little
  // less transparent still.
  // Nudged again, 2026-07-27 (0.75 -> 0.85): seen in actual daytime light
  // (photo much more visible than in the screenshots the earlier passes
  // were judged against), the wildflower background was still showing
  // through Home's cards and every tab's resting-prompt box too strongly.
  surface: initialGround.surface,
  // Translucent as of 2026-07-26, same reasoning as `surface` above --
  // this is the background behind actual typed TextInput fields

  // boxes stood out as solid rectangles against everything else's
  // "sitting over the photo" look. Same RGB as before, given its own alpha
  // rather than raised toward opaque like `surface`/the resting-prompt
  // card were -- explicitly requested to go the other direction, more
  // see-through, not less.
  // Dropped further, same day, alongside `surface`'s own reversal above --
  // same 0.2 target, so an input field doesn't read as a noticeably more
  // solid rectangle sitting inside a now much more translucent form card.
  // Nudged back up +10 points alongside `surface`'s own, same day (0.2 ->
  // 0.3), for the same "a little too transparent" reason.

  // above -- a change here shouldn't ripple into screens that haven't been
  // individually checked against it. More washed out than `textMuted` on

  // active by deliberate contrast, not full AA-level legibility -- an
  // icon glyph isn't a critical reading-text element).
  // Darkened further on request (58% -> 50% lightness, same ~15%
  // saturation). Now ~1.6:1 against `menuSurface` -- genuinely low, at the
  // point where this is purely a "recede into the background" color
  // rather than one held to any real legibility standard. That's the
  // explicit goal here (push the resting icon down so any active color
  // pops by comparison). This token now covers the icon glyph only --

  // darkened the label underneath it as a side effect -- fine for a small
  // glyph, but real word-shaped text read as too dim at that lightness.

  // Schedules/Trends/Reports were revised 2026-07-26 after real on-device
  // testing found each one nearly invisible against TabHub's own menu
  // background (`surface`, #45546F): Schedules had originally been set to
  // that *exact* color (0 contrast, not just low -- it wasn't dim, it was
  // literally the same color as what's behind it), Trends measured ~1.7:1,
  // Reports ~1.3:1, both far under the 3:1 minimum for a UI element to
  // read as visible at all.
  //
  // Schedules was revised twice more the same day: the first fix (a pale
  // periwinkle, #8FA8E8) cleared contrast against `surface` but landed too
  // close to `textMuted` (also a blue-gray) in both lightness AND hue, so
  // an active Schedules icon barely read as different from an inactive
  // one. Blue is a genuinely hard color here -- a vivid, saturated blue
  // tends to be too dark to clear 3:1 against this background at all
  // (checked and rejected several candidates for exactly this: pushing
  // saturation by dropping both R and G costs too much luminance; pushing
  // it by raising G to compensate drifts the hue toward Insights' cyan).
  // The current value keeps R low and G/B both high to stay on the blue
  // side of that boundary, landing at ~81% HSL saturation (vs ~24% for
  // `textMuted`) while still clearing 3:1 against `surface` (~3.1:1).
  // Rebuilt entirely 2026-07-26: the incremental fixes above (each color
  // separately pushed just enough to clear 3:1) had drifted wildly
  // inconsistent in saturation -- measured HSL saturation ranged from 32%
  // to 81% across the seven, which is exactly why Signals and
  // Schedules stood out as "too vivid" next to the rest. All seven are now
  // built from one shared HSL lightness (75%) and saturation (55%), a true
  // pastel set differentiated by hue alone, with hues deliberately
  // re-spread to ~25/45/95/150/195/230/280 degrees (evenly apart, not the
  // somewhat clustered angles the earlier ad-hoc picks landed on -- Home
  // and Reports had drifted to within 2 degrees of each other, for
  // instance). Every value below is individually re-verified against
  // `surface`, not assumed from the shared formula: contrast ranges from
  // ~3.3:1 (Schedules, blue is still the hardest hue to keep light enough)
  // up to ~5.3:1 (Food, nÃ©e Meals).
  tabHome: '#E2D19C',
  // 2026-10-29. The Home bands that belong to no tab (Your Guide, One Next
  // Thing, Sort It Out, Waiting for an Answer, the shared folder nudge)

  // analysis, and it measured 0.051 from tabFood in OKLab -- the closest pair
  // in the whole palette, sitting directly beside it in the menu.
  //
  // Blue was the obvious answer and turned out to be unreachable: every blue
  // light enough to clear this app's own contrast floors (4.5:1 as a fill
  // under textOnPrimary, 3:1 as text on the darkest surface) lands on top of
  // tabTrends or tabSchedules, because the pastel band's blue region is
  // already full. #4A90D9 was tried first and fails both at 4.34:1 and 2.08:1.
  //
  // So it took Life's orchid, the two exchanging colours. A rose (#EA90BD) was
  // tried over it briefly the same day and reverted within the hour: it came
  // from the one hue arc the palette leaves open (roughly 330-360) and measured
  // better on paper, 0.130 from its nearest neighbour against the orchid's
  // 0.094, but read as too bright on a real screen. Reported plainly: "a little
  // too bright or dayglo." Separation is only worth having if the result is
  // something someone wants to look at, and 0.094 is close enough to the 0.10
  // line to be the better trade.
  //
  // The orchid clears both floors comfortably: 6.9:1 as a fill, 3.3:1 as text.
  //
  // Trends keeps the sky blue rather than trading for it. Both tabs have a

  // Schedules and Trends both got a further saturation bump on top of the
  // shared formula (55% -> 65% and 70% respectively) once the background
  // fix above was in place and confirmed working, purely to stand out
  // more. Checked contrast on each before committing, since saturation
  // and luminance trade off in hue-specific ways that aren't always
  // intuitive (this exact thing derailed Schedules twice before): Trends'
  // teal-leaning hue tolerates the boost with no other change needed, but
  // Schedules' blue would have dropped back under 3:1 on saturation alone,
  // so it also got a small compensating lightness increase (75% -> 77%)
  // alongside the saturation bump. Schedules is the one color in the set
  // that isn't at the exact shared lightness, for that specific,
  // documented reason -- not a sign the underlying diagnosis was wrong.
  // Pushed once more after finding the actual reason the previous
  // attempt still didn't pop: the icon's pill background (see TabHub.tsx)
  // is a 24%-opacity tint of the icon's *own* color, so brightening the
  // icon also brightens its own backdrop, a self-referential ceiling that
  // doesn't show up if you only check contrast against the raw menu
  // background. Tested darker/richer first, on the theory that a deeper
  // "true periwinkle" might read as more present -- it measured *worse*
  // (~2.2:1), confirming darker is the wrong direction against a
  // background this dark, same as every other fix in this set. The actual
  // fix is more of what's already worked: lighter and more saturated
  // still (55%->80% saturation, 75%->82% lightness), specifically sized
  // to clear 3:1 against its *own pill*, not just the raw background.

  // unambiguous violet-purple instead.
  //
  // 2026-07-28: reported as still not "purply" enough even at the right
  // hue -- same fix already proven on tabSchedules (see that color's own

  // family, just a stronger version of it"). Checked, not assumed: this
  // also raises contrast against `menuSurface` from ~2.9:1 to ~3.5:1,

  // 2026-07-28 (same day, later): asked to match a real photo of a purple

  // (pngjs) and scanned every pixel for the awareness-ribbon's own
  // purple-ish tones (excluding the photo's black background and deep
  // shadow folds), bucketed by rounded color, ranked by frequency. Hue
  // held remarkably steady across every bucket regardless of how dark or
  // lit that part of the fabric was (277-280 degrees, all consistent).
  // Rotated hue from 262 to 278 to match it -- reverted the same day,
  // reported as reading pink again on an actual device. In hindsight this
  // re-created the exact problem hue 280 already caused earlier in this
  // same comment (R and B channels landing too close together at this
  // saturation/lightness): 278 has an R-B gap of only -27 versus 262's
  // -47, not nearly enough separation to clear the same pink/magenta
  // boundary documented above. The ribbon photo's own real hue simply
  // sits inside that boundary at this palette's saturation/lightness
  // recipe -- now that the ribbon icon itself is a recolorable vector
  // shape (see components/PurpleRibbonIcon.tsx), not a raster photo, there's
  // no remaining reason to chase the photo's exact hue over one that
  // actually reads as purple, so this reverts to 262 for good.
  //
  // 2026-08-23, direct report, hue itself confirmed still correct: "Is
  // there a darker color of purple that we can use... It really seems to
  // be way more pink than purple to me. Make sure it is within the same
  // family as the color already in use." The earlier history above
  // already ruled out hue as the lever (262 measurably clears the pink/
  // magenta boundary better than 278/280 ever did) -- what it never
  // tested was this color's own unusually high saturation/lightness (80/
  // 82, a deliberate 2026-07-28 bump specifically because the STANDARD
  // pastel formula, 55/75, read "not purply enough"). At 82% lightness,
  // even a hue that measures as unambiguous violet on paper can still
  // perceptually read as a pale lavender-pink to the eye, the same reason
  // "lavender" gets called pink far more often than "purple" does at any
  // hue. Same hue (262), same family, lightness and saturation both
  // brought down together (82->74, 80->72) instead of raised further:
  // richer and measurably darker without re-approaching the 275-280
  // boundary from a different direction. Checked, not assumed: still
  // 5.27:1 against `textOnPrimary` (this color's own solid-fill button
  // text, e.g. the new Digest breadcrumb/Glossary pills), comfortably
  // above every floor this set is held to. The one honest tradeoff:
  // contrast against `menuSurface`/`colors.surface`, where this color is
  // sometimes used AS text (TabHub/LensHub's own picker labels,
  // `categoryHeaderText`), drops from ~3.5:1 to ~2.5-2.7:1, under the 3:1
  // floor this file's own comments elsewhere hold tab-identity colors to.
  // Accepted rather than solved a second way: every one of those specific
  // text uses already carries `menuLabelShadow` or an equivalent shadow
  // (the same legibility work already done throughout this Digest screen
  // 2026-08-21/23 for exactly this class of marginal-contrast text-on-
  // surface pairing), not a fresh, unmitigated regression. Worth an

  // already named in the comment above: `tabPurpleDigest` reading as text
  // directly on `colors.surface`/`menuSurface` (category headers, topic
  // menu labels, shelf and entry titles) was the exact contrast gap
  // flagged as needing an on-device look before calling it settled, and

  // green color but one that isn't so intense." Replaced with Emerald
  // (#50C878), another real, named color rather than a computed one --
  // same green family, genuinely softer and brighter rather than dark and

  // rotated again to 262 (see `tabPurpleDigest`'s own comment, which is
  // correct). Nothing there is false; it is history written in the present

// How much lighter a TabHub/LensHub grid label's own font color reads than

// muted token for an inactive item) -- 2026-08-21, direct request: "make
// the font color be a little bit lighter colored... so the words are more
// clear and easy to read." A fraction of `lighten`'s own remaining-headroom
// mix, same mechanism as INPUT_BACKGROUND_LIGHTEN_FRACTION above, not a
// flat token swap -- both files' label colors are computed per-item at
// render time (a different hex per tab/condition), so there's no single
// fixed color to just replace. Deliberately NOT a change to the underlying
// tokens themselves (colors.primary, colors.menuLabelMuted, each tab's own
// route.color) -- those are shared far beyond just these two menus' own
// label text (icons, borders, other screens entirely), so lightening them
// directly would ripple into places never asked to change. This only
// touches the label TEXT color at its two call sites.
// Raised from 0.25 to 0.45, same day, direct follow-up: "I think they
// need... still a lighter color of font" once seen against the first
// pass. See menuLabelShadow's own comment in constants/typography.ts for
// the matching drop-shadow follow-up.

// (hueShift, IRIDESCENT_PALETTE, rotatedIridescentPalette, iridescentSheen)
// is removed entirely -- a real, confirmed, continuous battery drain, not
// just a visual choice. ScreenHeader.tsx's own app-name text needed the
// rotating rainbow driven through a real JS-thread bridge (react-native-svg's
// <Stop> can't be animated purely on the native thread), which fired up to
// 10 times a second, the whole time the app was open on any tab -- reported
// directly, investigated, and root-caused, not guessed at. What replaces it:
// every screen's header/footer text and lines, TabHub's popup card border,
// and the app's floating hub icon (Home included) are now flat, static
// colors -- see components/GenericBackground.tsx's own GENERIC_BACKGROUND_
// PALETTES (each combination now carries an explicit `lighter` accent used
// for exactly this) and components/ActiveRingCircle.tsx (the "this is
// selected" ring, now a flat colors.primary border, no animation, no
// gradient trick needed since it's one color). "Features that stay active
// but not animated" -- the explicit direction this replacement follows.

// close-but-different one per screen. Tune LIGHTEN_FRACTION/ALPHA here,

// than alpha-blended: the popover floats via a portal over arbitrary
// content (OverlayContext.tsx), not a known card background the way a
// closed field sits on, so alpha isn't a safe option here. 2026-08-08,
// added for Profile's own picker fields: "dark grey [for] the line and

// The nutrient fuel gauges on Home, 2026-08-29. Direct report: the ring

// to their optimal amount?"
//
// Fair, and the old scheme was worse than arbitrary: it reused the
// green/yellow/red status palette, so a nutrient at 20% and one at 85%
// were both drawn in the same single colour with nothing to separate
// them, and the "green" token here (statusGood) is a deliberately muted
// beige that never read as "you are there."
//
// So the ring's colour now moves continuously with how close the day's
// intake is to the target: GAUGE_EMPTY at nothing logged through to
// GAUGE_OPTIMAL at the target. The hue travel is real (a cool, receding
// slate through to a clear green), so the colour carries the same
