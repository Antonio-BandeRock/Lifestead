// Sharing a saved creation/favorite/curated recipe with someone else --
// moved out of lib/db.ts on 2026-08-15 into its own real, focused leaf
// module (was a single "--- Sharing ---" block inside the mega-file),
// specifically so it can safely import lib/mealPhotos.ts's own real photo-
// compress/base64 pipeline: lib/db.ts is the one file every other leaf
// module already imports FROM, never the reverse, and mealPhotos.ts itself
// needs to import getDatabase/COMPONENT_TABLE_BY_TYPE/MealComponentType
// from db.ts -- keeping the sharing logic in db.ts too would have made
// db.ts need to import mealPhotos.ts, a real circular-import risk this
// project's own history already warns against (see lib/db.ts's own
// "backwards direction" self-correction note on reportGenerator.ts).
//
// This app has no company server and never will (see CLAUDE.md's own
// "Local-first, no company server holding health data" architecture
// decision) -- so sharing a real creation with someone else can't go
// through anything this app itself hosts. Built entirely on two real,
// already-registered pieces: this app's own hashimotosapp:// deep-link
// scheme (app.json) and React Native's built-in Share API. The wire format
// is plain, human-readable JSON in the link's own query string, URL-
// encoded by Linking.createURL (expo-linking) so the exact scheme/path
// always matches whatever this specific build is actually configured for.
//
// A real photo, when the sender has one, travels the same way -- there is
// no server to host it on, so the only way it can cross from one phone to
// another is embedded directly as base64 bytes inside this same envelope
// (see lib/mealPhotos.ts's own prepareSharePhoto, deliberately capped
// small since it has to ride inside a shareable link/message, not just sit
// on local disk).
//
// Receiving a share, 2026-08-15 direct request, changed from an immediate
// permanent import into a real staging area: a shared item now lands in
// shared_recipes (a genuine local table, distinct from both the 11 saved-
// record tables and favorites) and shows up under Digest's My
// Kitchen as "Recipes Shared With Me" until the person explicitly decides
// to save it to their own recipes, save it as a favorite, or just delete
// it -- see promoteSharedRecipeToSaved/promoteSharedRecipeToFavorite/
// deleteSharedRecipe below. The old, direct-to-permanent-save
// importSharedItem is gone -- this staging flow replaces it entirely.
//
// Step 6 of the real device-pairing prerequisite list, 2026-08-15 (see
// CLAUDE.md's own "Sharing individual recipes between two people"
// security-requirement note) -- a real, second delivery mechanism for the
// exact same real, signed envelope this file already builds: a genuine
// local .is file (writeIsFile/writeIsFileForComponent/
// writeIsFileForCuratedRecipe/writeIsFileForMeal, below), registered with
// Android/iOS at the OS level (see app.json's own real android.
// intentFilters, and lib/isFileLinking.ts's own receiving side) so tapping
// a received .is file from ANY app opens it directly here, not just a
// hashimotosapp:// deep link reached through this app's own share sheet.
// The .is file's own real content is deliberately plain, un-base64'd JSON
// (a file has no URL-safety constraint the way a query string does) --
// see writeIsFile's own comment for the full reasoning.
