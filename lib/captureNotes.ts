// The capture inbox: somewhere to throw a thought before it evaporates.
//
// 2026-09-16, direct instruction, after the reminder coverage work the same
// day: "then the capture inbox". The reason it exists, in the tracker row's
// own words: this app has plenty of places to PUT a thing and nowhere to
// THROW one. Every capture path already built (Log Again, Say What You Ate,
// the barcode scanner) knows what kind of thing it is receiving before it
// starts. This one must not.
//
// So capture asks nothing. No category, no date, no form, no decision. One
// field and one microphone, and the words are kept exactly as they arrived.
// Deciding what "call the dentist" actually is happens afterwards, on the
// person's own time, which is the easy half.
//
// Pure on purpose: no database, no React, no colours, so the rules below can
// be checked in plain node (scripts/test_capture_notes.js) and so both the
// screen and the database module can read them without a cycle.

// Typed or spoken. Kept because the two read differently later: a spoken note
// carries whatever the recognizer heard, so a person re-reading a strange line
// deserves to know a microphone wrote it rather than their own thumbs. A
// photo note (1.0.53.7) is one thrown in with the camera, its words whatever
// was in the box at the time or PHOTO_CAPTURE_TEXT when nothing was. A
// shared note (C11, 2026-10-02) came in from another app's Share sheet, so
// its words are that app's rather than the person's (lib/shareIntake.ts).
