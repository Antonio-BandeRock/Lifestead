// Signing in to OneDrive, so the app can reach a folder rather than guess at one.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHY EVERY CHEAPER ROUTE WAS TRIED FIRST. The
// requirement was stated plainly: be able to CHOOSE a shared cloud folder, with
// the app knowing which one, rather than typing a name and hoping. Three Android
// mechanisms were fired at a real phone to see whether the operating system
// could do it:
//
//   ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE (pick a folder)  OneDrive is not offered.
//   ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT   (save a new file) OneDrive is not offered.
//   ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT     (open a file)     OneDrive IS offered.
//
// So OneDrive's Android provider hands out single files and nothing else. No
// amount of app code changes that, because the decision belongs to OneDrive's
// own provider. Talking to Microsoft Graph directly is the only remaining way to
// enumerate folders, and it is what this file makes possible.
//
// NO NATIVE REBUILD. Every piece is already compiled into the installed build:
// expo-web-browser opens the sign-in page and catches the redirect, expo-crypto
// does PKCE, expo-secure-store holds the refresh token, and fetch moves the
// bytes. This ships over an ordinary update.
//
// NO CLIENT SECRET. A secret shipped inside an app is not a secret, so this is a
// PUBLIC client and the authorization code is protected by PKCE instead: a
// random value made per sign-in, hashed, and checked by Microsoft against the
// original.
//
// ON A COMPUTER THERE IS NO SIGN-IN. The OneDrive client on the machine is
// already signed in and keeps its folder on the disk, which is where
// lib/desktop/cloudFolder.ts reads and writes. Asking the person to sign in
// again would be asking for something the app does not use, and on a PC it
// could not finish anyway: Microsoft's redirect goes to hashimotosapp://,
// which nothing on a computer is registered for, so the 2026-09-21 attempt
// "kept waiting and waiting and never completed". So isSignedIn answers yes,
// signIn succeeds without opening anything, and signOut has nothing to
// forget.
