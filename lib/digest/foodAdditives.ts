      "The nitrates-nitrites entry above cites IARC's global monograph, which weighs evidence gathered from dozens of studies worldwide and lands on a category, Group 1 carcinogen, not a number anyone can act on day to day. UK Biobank gives that category an actual shape. Tracking 474,996 UK adults for a mean of 6.9 years, researchers found each additional 20 grams a day of processed meat, roughly two-thirds of a standard bacon rasher, tracked with an 18% higher risk of colorectal cancer (hazard ratio 1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.31). This study tested meat intake against several cancer types at once, and after correcting for that many comparisons, colorectal cancer was the one association that held up cleanly.\n\nA weaker link between red meat and prostate cancer, and between processed meat and rectal cancer specifically, didn't survive that same correction. One large, well-run cohort study still sits a tier below a meta-analysis pooling many of them, so this adds a concrete, quantified data point to the existing classification above rather than replacing it.",

    summary:
      "The already-cited 2024 umbrella review behind this app's repeated \"nearly 10 million people, 32 outcomes\" framing has more specific numbers than that headline alone conveys. It pooled 45 separate meta-analyses covering 9,888,373 people, and found a statistically significant direct association between ultra-processed food exposure and 32 of those 45 outcomes (71%).\n\nOf those 32, four reached the review's top classification, \"convincing\" (class I) evidence: cardiovascular disease-related mortality (risk ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 1.63), type 2 diabetes in a dose-response analysis (risk ratio 1.12, 1.11 to 1.13), anxiety (odds ratio 1.48, 1.37 to 1.59), and common mental disorder outcomes combined (odds ratio 1.53, 1.43 to 1.63).\n\nSeven more reached a second tier, \"highly suggestive\" (class II), including all-cause mortality (risk ratio 1.21), heart disease-related mortality (hazard ratio 1.66), type 2 diabetes without the dose-response requirement (odds ratio 1.40), depression (hazard ratio 1.22), adverse sleep outcomes (odds ratio 1.41), wheezing (risk ratio 1.40), and obesity (odds ratio 1.55).\n\nTo be precise about what \"class I convincing\" measures here: it's a rating of how strong and consistent an association is across the underlying meta-analyses (sample size, statistical significance, freedom from small-study bias), a different axis from GRADE certainty, which rates how trustworthy the underlying evidence itself is.\n\nType 2 diabetes's class I finding still carried only \"moderate\" GRADE certainty, and anxiety's only \"low.\" Independent reviewers reacting to the same paper made this point directly: even the top-tier findings here rest on observational data with residual confounding still in play, exactly the concern the paper's authors raise too. \"Convincing\" and \"proven\" aren't the same claim.",

    teaser: 'The nickname sounds like exaggeration. The same chemical is a dough conditioner in one and a foaming agent in the other.',
    summary:
      "\"The yoga mat chemical\" sounds like the kind of alarmist nickname that turns out to be an exaggeration on closer inspection. This one isn't. Azodicarbonamide is used both as a bleaching and dough-conditioning agent in bread and as a foaming agent in yoga mats and shoe soles, a true, if attention-grabbing, coincidence. It's banned in the EU, UK, and Australia. It breaks down during baking into semicarbazide, a compound animal studies link to tumor formation at high doses.\n\nU.S. Regulators haven't found the levels used in bread baking to pose a comparable risk, which is the crux of the international disagreement. Not a settled safety verdict in either direction, just two different regulatory judgment calls applied to the same chemistry.",

    teaser: 'Phosphorus is essential. The engineered, additive form of it behaves differently in the body than the same mineral occurring naturally in whole food.',
    summary: "Phosphorus is an essential mineral. Nobody's suggesting avoiding it. The additive form and the whole-food form aren't absorbed the same way. Phosphate additives, used as preservatives and texture enhancers in processed meat, cheese, and baked goods, are absorbed at roughly 90%, compared to 40-60% for phosphate naturally bound in whole foods like meat, dairy, and legumes, well-established physiology.\n\nWhat that difference does downstream is more open than often presented. A 3-week randomized crossover trial in early-stage CKD patients found higher phosphate-additive intake did raise urinary phosphorus excretion as expected, but did not significantly raise albuminuria or FGF23 in that specific trial. No thyroid-specific data exists here. The same nutrient behaves differently depending on its source, the same principle the food scoring is built on.",

    summary:
      "BHA and BHT get mentioned together often enough that it's easy to assume they carry the same concern. They don't. Each has its separate finding. BHA, butylated hydroxyanisole, is listed by the National Toxicology Program as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen, based on animal studies, and is more heavily restricted in the EU than the U.S. Its close chemical relative BHT has separate animal research showing measurable effects on circulating thyroid hormone levels at high doses.\n\nBoth remain FDA-approved at current use levels for preserving fats, oils, and cereal-based products from oxidation. Two different concerns, not one shared risk profile just because the names look similar.",

    teaser: 'Not every additive is a warning, and these two prove it.',
    summary:
      "A list built entirely around concerns risks implying every food additive deserves equal suspicion. Xanthan and guar gum push back against that impression. Both xanthan gum and guar gum are fermentation- or plant-derived thickeners used across gluten-free baking, sauces, and dairy alternatives. Neither has a meaningful body of evidence linking normal dietary use to harm.\n\nGuar gum in particular has positive, if modest, data as a soluble fiber source supporting gut motility and short-chain fatty acid production. These two thickeners keep the additive list from implying every additive deserves equal suspicion. Teaching what's fine is as much a part of food literacy as flagging what isn't.",

    summary: "Read one at a time, these 19 entries can look like an intimidating list of unrelated dangers. Read together, a pattern emerges: nearly every documented risk here is a chronic, cumulative-exposure finding (a 12-week mouse trial, a multi-year cohort, a 5-year sweetener threshold), not a single-serving danger. The useful question is how often something shows up across an ongoing diet, which is what the longitudinal tracking is built to help notice. Two entries (MSG, xanthan/guar gum) make the other half of the point: not everything on a typical \"avoid\" list holds up under scrutiny.",
