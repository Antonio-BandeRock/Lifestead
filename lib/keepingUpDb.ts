// The reads behind Trends > Keeping Up.
//
// Everything that decides anything lives in lib/keepingUp.ts, which imports
// only the week arithmetic and is covered by scripts/test_keeping_up.js.
// This file fetches and nothing else.
//
// Five sources, and they are not equally old. done_check_marks, capture_notes
// and work_checkins have kept every row since the day they shipped, so those
// three bands can look back as far as somebody has been using the app.
// routine_runs and upkeep_doings started on 2026-09-23, because routines and
// upkeep each kept one stamp and overwrote it. Those two bands say so rather
// than drawing a chart of a range they cannot see into.
//
// One thing here is easy to get wrong and would quietly break every streak
// in the lens. done_check_marks, capture_notes and routine_runs all store
// `new Date().toISOString()`, which is UTC, so slicing the first ten
// characters off one gives the UTC day rather than the day the person was
// living in. Six hours west of Greenwich, everything marked after six in
// the evening would land on tomorrow, and a run of evening marks would read
// as no run at all. So a timestamp goes through a Date and comes back as
// the LOCAL day, which is what describeMarkMoment in lib/routines.ts has
// always done. upkeep_doings.done_on and work_checkins.week_of are already
// plain dates and need none of this.
//
// The same shift is why each SQL window reaches a day past the range at
// both ends: a row belonging to the first local day of the range can carry
// a UTC stamp before it. The extra rows are dropped by local day below.
//
// Two marks on one day are one day kept: nothing here counts taps.
