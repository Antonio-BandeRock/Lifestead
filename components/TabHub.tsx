// much wider 1.487 ratio left every condition icon rendering noticeably
// smaller than the butterfly, height-constrained inside that box rather

// icon (Gout) and a wide one (PCOS) both read as similarly "present" the

          GestureHandlerRootView, on the reasoning that a Modal opens a
          separate native window that doesn't automatically inherit the
          app root's own instance (a real, documented react-native-gesture-
          handler gotcha). This one had real, fresh, cross-component
          evidence behind it (confirmed gated on a WheelPicker being
          mounted elsewhere, AND that LensHub's own Modal shows the
          identical symptom under the identical condition -- ruling out
          anything TabHub-specific, which is exactly what the eight prior
          attempts couldn't do). Tried and confirmed on-device NOT to
          change the behavior at all, same as every attempt before it --
          removed rather than left in as dead, misleading scaffolding. The
          real trigger is confirmed narrowed to WheelPicker's own live
          Reanimated content (components/WheelPicker.tsx) coexisting with
          ANY subsequently-opened Modal, but the actual mechanism inside
          that is still unknown. Next real step needs on-device profiling
          (a screen recording at minimum, ideally Android's own "Profile
          GPU rendering" or a Flipper/systrace capture) rather than a

              supposed to let the real Activity's own dark colors.background
              show through behind the nav bar, but Android's Dialog-based
              Modal doesn't reliably composite that in the system-bar-inset
              strip itself -- reported as that strip turning solid black
              specifically while this menu is open, on a 3-button (not
              gesture) nav bar. Rather than depend on that compositing being
              correct, this paints real colors.background pixels there
              directly, so it's right regardless of what Android does
              underneath. pointerEvents: 'none' -- purely cosmetic, must
