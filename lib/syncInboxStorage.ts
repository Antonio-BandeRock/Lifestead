// Reading and writing the shared folder, and remembering which folder it is.
//
// The half of the carrier that touches the device. lib/syncInbox.ts holds the
// naming and addressing rules and is pure, so it can be tested in plain node;
// everything here needs a real folder and a real picker and cannot be, which is
// why the two are separate files rather than one. The same split
// lib/groceryList.ts and lib/groceryDb.ts already use.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO ACCOUNT ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE. The OneDrive API route was
// built as far as a live app registration and then ruled out on evidence:
// Graph's createLink needs Files.ReadWrite for a personal account, meaning full
// read and write access to somebody's entire OneDrive, to create the share link
// the design depends on. Disproportionate for a few hundred bytes, and the
// consent screen says so in those words to whoever is being asked. A folder the
// person picks needs no registration, no scope and no provider at all: whatever
// already syncs that folder moves the bytes, so the same code works over any
// folder a sync app keeps on the phone, or a plain SD card, without knowing
// which. The Google Drive and Dropbox apps do not offer their folders in
// Android's picker, so those reach it through a sync app (lib/phoneFolder.ts).
//
// NOTHING FROM expo-file-system IS IMPORTED AT MODULE SCOPE. Every call goes
// through an await import() inside the function that needs it, the discipline
// lib/customBackgroundImage.ts established and lib/dataBackup.ts, lib/sharing.ts,
// lib/mealPhotos.ts and lib/isFileLinking.ts already follow.
//
// THIS NEEDED NO NATIVE REBUILD. Directory.pickDirectoryAsync is part of
// expo-file-system's SDK 54 class-based API, and that package is already linked
// into the shipped build; its presence was confirmed against the real type
// declarations and against the native Kotlin and Swift sources before anything
// here was written, rather than assumed from the docs.
//
// EVERY OPERATION REPORTS RATHER THAN THROWS. A folder chosen months ago can be
// gone: the permission revoked in Android settings, an SD card removed, the
// folder deleted from the other end of a sync. That is an ordinary state to
// explain, not an exception to crash on, so each function returns a result the
// caller can put on screen.
