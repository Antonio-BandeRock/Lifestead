  // 2026-08-11, a real, reported gap in that "fails open" design: it only

  // genuinely HUNG one that never settles at all. Reported exactly that
  // way: DatabaseSetupScreen's own progress estimate climbed to its 95%
  // cap and then sat there indefinitely, the app never opening. The
  // reference database is a real, large (~130MB+) one-time SQLite asset
  // copy -- expo-sqlite's importDatabaseFromAssetAsync has no documented
  // timeout of its own, and if the native call genuinely never calls back
  // (not just slow, but stuck), nothing above this ever fires, and
  // referenceImportResolved never becomes true.
  //
  // Fixed with a bounded startup-only safety net, deliberately NOT placed
  // inside getReferenceDatabase() itself: that function's own contract
  // stays a truthful reflection of the real import for every other real
  // caller in the app (a screen mid-session correctly SHOULD keep waiting
  // for real data, however long it takes, not give up early). This timer
  // only decides how long the STARTUP GATE specifically is willing to wait
  // before letting the person into the app anyway -- it does not cancel or
  // otherwise affect the real underlying import, which keeps running in
  // the background and, if it does eventually succeed, still correctly
  // becomes the memoized result every other real caller uses from that
  // point on.
  //
  // Generous on purpose -- a real ~130MB one-time copy can legitimately
  // take a while on a slow device, well past the loading screen's own
  // ~30-60 second estimate. This is a last resort, not a normal path.
  // Hoisted out of the effect below, 2026-08-27, so the second, longer

          entirely. Reported as real, confirmed battery drain: it forced a
          real JS-thread update up to 10 times a second, the whole time the
          app was open on any tab (react-native-svg's <Stop>, used by
          ScreenHeader's app-name text, can't be driven purely on the
          native thread). See constants/colors.ts's own header note for the
          full replacement -- every one of those elements is now a flat,
          static color instead ("features that stay active but not
          animated"), with no shared animation value left to provide. */}

                a Stack.Screen's own NATIVE container has no guaranteed
                opaque backing of its own -- it relies entirely on whatever
                its JS content happens to paint, at the React Navigation/
                react-native-screens level, one layer below anything this
                app's own code controls. Added directly in response to a
                real, confirmed report and screenshot: the (tabs) group's
                own persistently-mounted background (including
                ScreenBackground.tsx's footer divider) was visibly showing
                through profile.tsx, a Stack-pushed screen that should be
                fully opaque over whatever's mounted behind it. This gives
                every screen a guaranteed solid backing at the native
                container level itself, not just wherever this app's own
                Views happen to paint one. */}
            {/* THE NAVIGATOR MOVES; THE KEYBOARD DOES NOT, 2026-09-09.

                Reported directly: the keyboard was covering whatever field
                was being typed into, on pretty much every screen. See
                components/KeyboardLift.tsx for why nothing already handled
                this (AppKeyboard is a View this app draws, so none of React
                Native's own keyboard-avoidance machinery ever hears about
                it) and why the fix lives under every field rather than on
                each screen.

                Only the Stack is wrapped, deliberately. AppKeyboard,
                OverlayRoot and VersionLabel are siblings BELOW this, so
                they are outside the provider as well as outside the lift:
                the keyboard stays put while the content slides behind it,
                and AppKeyboard's own search-row field (which lives above
                the keys and is never covered by anything) asks for no lift
                at all rather than uselessly shoving the app up by its own
