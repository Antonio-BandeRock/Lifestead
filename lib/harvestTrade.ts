// What happens to extra harvest, when it does not get eaten.
//
// Built 2026-09-05, from a direct extension of the income-streams work: "A
// sale via a harvest could be through a trade as well, and not monetary.
// They could have traded their extra potatoes for ears of corn, etc. In that
// case the receipt of goods would go directly into the kitchen as part of the
// food inventory."
//
// Three things can happen to a surplus, and they are structurally different:
//
//   sold    goods out, money in       -> an income receipt
//   traded  goods out, goods in       -> kitchen inventory, no money at all
//   given   goods out, nothing back   -> still worth recording
//
// A trade is the interesting one, because every budgeting tool would either
// ignore it or fake a price for it. It is real economic activity with no
// money in it anywhere.
//
// WHAT A TRADE IS WORTH, WHICH IS MOSTLY NOTHING.
//
// This app already settled the general question and the answer went the
// austere way: where the garden covered a grocery line, that is reported as a
// COUNT of lines that did not have to be bought, never a dollar saving,
// because what the produce would have cost is genuinely unknown and pricing
// it would be an invented number.
//
// A trade has one narrow exception, and it turns on a real distinction. If
// the app holds a RECORDED price for the food received, from an actual past
// grocery trip, then "what would this have cost me" is not unknown: it is
// measured, from that person's own shopping. So it can honestly say "8 kg of
// corn, and you last paid $2.40 a kg for corn, so about $19 you did not
// spend." Where there is no recorded price, it says nothing.
//
// Two hard rules follow, and both are tested:
//
//   1. That figure is an AVOIDED COST and never income. No money arrived. It
//      must never reach the income mix, or the "$X a month across N streams"
//      total would include money that does not exist.
//   2. It is only computed when the recorded price's unit MATCHES the unit
//      received. A price per package has no per-kilo meaning without a size,
//      and converting would be the invented number again by a longer route.
//      Same refusal mergeShoppingAmounts already makes about crossing weight
//      and volume.
//
// WHAT WAS GIVEN IS NEVER VALUED.
//
// Only the receiving side can be measured, and only sometimes. What someone's
// own potatoes were worth is exactly the unknown this app refuses to invent,
// and a trade valued on both sides would also be double counting one event.
