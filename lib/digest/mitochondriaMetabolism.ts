      "Most of this category has to borrow evidence from other diseases or general metabolic research. This one didn't need to. A study measured circulating MOTS-c, a peptide produced by mitochondria that regulates insulin sensitivity and inflammation, in 90 Hashimoto's patients against 90 matched controls, finding it significantly lower in the patient group. It was also inversely correlated with autoantibody levels, meaning lower MOTS-c tracked with a more active autoimmune process, not just a passive side effect sitting alongside it.\n\nA Hashimoto's-specific mitochondrial finding, not extrapolated from a different condition.

    title: 'The Chain From Sugar to Chronic Inflammation, Link by Link',
    teaser: 'A randomized trial isolated fructose, not sugar in general, as the driver of visceral fat and insulin resistance. A separate review picks up from there and explains what that fat then does.',
    summary:
      "The path from a sugary drink to chronic, body-wide inflammation runs through several distinct, well-documented steps, not one vague \"sugar is bad\" mechanism. A randomized trial isolated the first step precisely: 32 overweight or obese adults drank either glucose- or fructose-sweetened beverages, providing a quarter of daily calories, for 10 weeks. Both groups gained the same amount of weight.\n\nOnly the fructose group showed a measurable increase in visceral fat volume on MRI, a measurable rise in the liver's fat-manufacturing process (postprandial de novo lipogenesis, up from 11.4% to 16.9%), and a 17% drop in insulin sensitivity. The glucose group showed none of it. Fructose, almost uniquely among sugars, is processed nearly entirely by the liver, which is what routes it toward fat storage and insulin resistance in a way glucose doesn't. The next step happens inside the fat itself.\n\nAs visceral fat expands, it recruits immune cells, mostly macrophages, which can make up as much as 40% of all cells in obese adipose tissue, and those macrophages shift from a calming to an inflammatory phenotype. They secrete TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and MCP-1 directly into the tissue and, from there, into general circulation. Those cytokines activate two specific signaling pathways, JNK and NF-kB, that interfere with insulin's signaling machinery by chemically modifying a protein called IRS-1 in a way that blocks it from working.\n\nThat's how insulin resistance spreads: the same cytokines travel through the bloodstream and trigger the identical JNK/NF-kB disruption inside the liver and skeletal muscle, turning a local problem in fat tissue into a body-wide one. Put together: dietary fructose drives visceral fat formation directly, and visceral fat, once formed, becomes an active source of the exact inflammatory signals that spread insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation well beyond the fat tissue itself.",
