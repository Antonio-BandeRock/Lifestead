// How a long press, or the button, reaches the Tell Claude sheet.
//
// Part of the 2026-09-22 note channel; lib/devNotes.ts holds the shape of a
// note and the reasoning behind the whole thing, and is the pure module.
// This one carries three pieces of running state that a note needs and that
// no single screen can answer on its own:
//
//  1. WHERE YOU ARE. components/PageIdentityLabel.tsx renders on every
//     screen in this app and already receives the tab's title and the open
//     lens's label, which is exactly what a note has to say about itself.
//     It reports them here rather than each of the nine tabs being taught
//     to, so a screen added later is covered without anybody remembering.
//  2. WHETHER THE FEATURE IS ON AT ALL. Read at render rather than at press
//     time, because components/TabBand.tsx has to decide whether to hand its
//     band a long press: a Touchable carrying an onLongPress swallows the
//     tap that would otherwise follow, so wiring one unconditionally would
//     stop a band folding for somebody who never asked for any of this.
//  3. THE SHEET ITSELF. One listener, registered by the host at the app
//     root, so a band deep inside a clipped ScrollView can raise a sheet
//     that paints over the whole window.
//
// Deliberately a module rather than a React context: a band does not sit
// inside any provider this could reasonably be hung on, and threading one
// through nine tabs to carry a developer switch would be furniture in the
// way of the app.
