// studied purely as corroborating evidence for Hashimoto's own visceral-fat
// and gluten-responder-subgroup research, written for a Hashimoto's reader.
// This category is the opposite direction -- psoriasis as its own real,

//
// Every citation here was independently verified via WebSearch before being
// written in, the same discipline the rest of this Digest already holds to.
// Two entries (vitamin D and omega-3) are deliberately honest about mixed or
// null evidence rather than smoothed into a false positive -- worth reading
// alongside RA's own strong omega-3 finding as a real example of the same
// nutrient carrying different evidence weight for a different disease.
//
// 2026-08-08, same day, grew to 15 entries: 4 real, disease-specific self-

    teaser: 'Visible on the outside, but driven by the same overactive immune system already tracked throughout this research.',
    summary:
      "Psoriasis is the immune system driving skin cells to multiply far faster than normal, piling up into the thick, scaly, often itchy plaques the disease is known for. Roughly a third of people with psoriasis go on to develop psoriatic arthritis, a related form that attacks the joints the way rheumatoid arthritis does. Despite looking like a purely dermatological condition, psoriasis shares biology with every other autoimmune disease in this app: the same inflammatory cytokines, a documented link to obesity and metabolic disease, and a documented, if partial, overlap with gluten sensitivity in a specific subgroup of patients. Diet won't cure psoriasis, and nothing here replaces a dermatologist's treatment plan. What follows is what the actual research supports, including the places where the evidence is mixed rather than settled.",

    summary: "Of everything studied for psoriasis, intentional weight loss carries the clearest trial evidence. A randomized clinical study put obese psoriasis patients on a low-energy diet, roughly 800 to 1,000 calories a day for eight weeks, then reintroduced food gradually over another eight weeks, and found significant improvement in disease severity compared to a control group eating their usual diet. A more recent systematic review pooling multiple randomized trials found the same pattern held up at scale: weight-loss interventions produced an average PASI reduction of 2.5 points more than control, and meaningfully raised the odds of reaching PASI75, a 75% improvement in symptoms, the same bar most psoriasis drug trials use to define success. The obesity-psoriasis relationship runs both directions. Obesity worsens psoriasis through the same low-grade systemic inflammation the Mitochondria & Metabolism research covers for visceral fat, and psoriasis itself can make weight loss harder. A 10 to 15% reduction in body weight is the specific target the strongest trials point to, not an indefinite goal.",

      "Alcohol's relationship with psoriasis is one of the more consistently documented lifestyle links in this whole category, though the exact shape of it depends on who's being studied. Increasing alcohol use tracks with worsening psoriasis severity and a poorer response to systemic treatment, and heavy drinking shows up significantly more often in men with severe disease than men with mild disease. Some studies found a striking relative risk as high as 8.01 for plaque-type psoriasis in men who drink heavily, while the same research didn't find a comparable increased risk in women drinking at typical levels, though at least one separate study found elevated risk in women drinking 2.3 or more drinks a week. What isn't in dispute is a separate, striking finding: people with psoriasis carry roughly 60% higher alcohol-related mortality than the general population of the same age and sex, a reason to take alcohol screening seriously in psoriasis care regardless of how the severity link ultimately resolves.",

    summary: "The Other Autoimmune Diseases category already names the headline finding: a specific subgroup of psoriasis patients test positive for gliadin antibodies, and that exact subgroup sees measurable skin improvement on a gluten-free diet. What's worth adding here is the mechanism, because it's more concrete than most diet-and-skin findings get. Researchers biopsied the skin of gliadin antibody-positive psoriasis patients before and after three months on a gluten-free diet and found tissue transglutaminase, an enzyme that was highly overexpressed in the affected skin's blood vessel lining, dropped by roughly 50%. A marker of active cell proliferation in the skin dropped significantly too. Roughly 16% of people with plaque psoriasis carry these antibodies, a testable minority rather than a universal trigger. If psoriasis runs in a family alongside celiac disease or other gluten-related conditions, this is a concrete, biopsy-confirmed reason to ask a doctor about antibody testing before assuming a gluten-free diet either will or won't help.",

    summary:
      "Nightshade avoidance, cutting out tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, and eggplant, is some of the most commonly repeated psoriasis diet advice online, and the actual evidence for it is thin. The proposed mechanism centers on solanine, a compound in the nightshade family that some believe drives inflammation. Solanine does exist, but it concentrates almost entirely in the leaves and stems of these plants, not the parts anyone actually eats, and the amount present in a normal serving of tomato or potato is far below what would be needed to produce any measurable inflammatory effect. No clinical trial has tested nightshade elimination in psoriasis specifically. What exists instead is a split in anecdotal reports: some people say cutting nightshades helped, most see no difference at all, and dietitians disagree on whether the pattern means anything. That doesn't make it worthless to test personally, as long as the test doesn't assume the answer in advance. A short elimination of a few weeks, followed by a deliberate reintroduction, is the only way to actually find out whether this applies to any one person's body.",

      "Vitamin D's relationship with psoriasis is more complicated than it first appears, and worth separating clearly into two different questions. Topical vitamin D analogs applied directly to plaques, like calcipotriene, are a well-established, first-line psoriasis treatment with strong evidence behind them. Oral, dietary-style vitamin D supplementation is a separate question with a much less settled answer. One randomized, placebo-controlled trial found a significant improvement in psoriasis severity at three months on vitamin D2. A larger, longer trial giving 100,000 IU of vitamin D3 monthly for a full year found no difference in severity between the vitamin D group and placebo at any point, even though blood vitamin D levels rose as expected in both groups. A meta-analysis pooling the available randomized trials initially found a favorable effect at six months, but that result stopped being statistically significant once a stricter statistical adjustment was applied. Oral vitamin D supplementation for psoriasis specifically remains unproven, different from the well-supported topical route, and not something to expect a skin-clearing result from on its own.",

For RA, omega-3 supplementation carries strong, repeated trial evidence. For psoriasis, the picture is weaker. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found fish oil taken alone had no measurable effect on PASI score, lesion area, or itching. Five trials in the same body of research found some benefit; eight found none, and pooled together, fish oil supplementation wasn't associated with reduced disease severity when used by itself. The one place omega-3s showed promise was in combination with standard psoriasis treatment rather than as a stand-alone approach, several reviews found an added benefit when fish oil was paired with conventional therapy rather than used on its own. The same nutrient, studied with rigor in two different autoimmune diseases, landing in two different places, is exactly the kind of disease-specific distinction worth holding onto rather than assuming one finding transfers automatically to the next condition.",

    summary:
      "Cyclosporine, a systemic immunosuppressant used for severe psoriasis, has one of the more concrete and well-measured food-drug interactions covered anywhere here. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice block an intestinal enzyme, CYP3A4, that normally breaks down part of an oral cyclosporine dose before it fully absorbs into the bloodstream. With that enzyme blocked, more of the dose gets through. Clinical measurements found blood cyclosporine levels running more than 60% higher after grapefruit juice, a large enough shift to push an already-therapeutic dose into overdose territory, not a subtle nutrient-timing effect. Because cyclosporine already carries kidney and blood-pressure risks that scale with dose, this isn't an interaction to try timing around. The straightforward, doctor-supported approach is avoiding grapefruit and grapefruit juice entirely for as long as cyclosporine treatment continues.",

    summary: "Acitretin, an oral retinoid used for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, carries one of the more serious food-and-substance interactions covered anywhere. Alcohol taken during acitretin treatment converts the drug into etretinate, a related retinoid with a dramatically longer half-life, roughly 120 days compared to acitretin's 49 hours. That single conversion matters enormously because acitretin, like every retinoid, carries a teratogenic risk, meaning it can cause serious birth defects. A drug that normally clears the body in days instead lingers, in one documented case, still detectable in blood and fat tissue 52 months after the last dose was taken, because of alcohol consumed during treatment.

Modern dermatology guidance combines PASI with a quality-of-life measure (DLQI, the Dermatology Life Quality Index) and location, since a smaller affected area on the face, palms, or genitals can carry psychosocial impact severe enough to be treated as more serious than the raw percentage alone suggests.

    summary: "Psoriasis's documented history starts with an overdue correction: in 1808, physician Robert Willan produced the first clinical description distinguishing psoriasis from leprosy, two conditions that had been confused together for centuries, a consequential misclassification given how differently the two conditions were treated and regarded. It took until 1963 for E. J. Van Scott to identify psoriasis as an autoimmune disorder, and until 1973 for a landmark paper (Moll and Wright) to establish psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis as one connected disease, distinct from rheumatoid arthritis, the same distinction the RA and Psoriasis categories reflect by being built as separate conditions. Methotrexate, introduced in 1958, was approved specifically for psoriasis in 1972; the more recent turning point came in 2003, when the first biologic agents for psoriasis reached FDA approval, targeting the same specific inflammatory pathways (TNF-alpha, later IL-23/IL-17) the systemic-comorbidity research above traces directly to psoriasis's whole-body effects.",

    summary: "Psoriasis during pregnancy shows a mixed picture, not a reliable improvement the way the Rheumatoid Arthritis research documents for that condition: data finds 40-60% of pregnant people with psoriasis improve, 10-20% worsen, and the remainder stay stable, meaning pregnancy is a coin-flip-adjacent outcome here, not a dependable remission window. What IS reliably common: a postpartum flare, affecting 65-73% of people in cohort studies, with most flares occurring within the first four months after delivery. A reassuring, more recent finding: growing evidence supports biologic medications as safe during pregnancy for psoriasis specifically, with research finding no increased risk of miscarriage or congenital malformation from biologic exposure, and minimal transfer into breast milk for the four injectable biologics studied. The practical risk sits the other way: stopping biologics before or during pregnancy carries a higher likelihood of a moderate-to-severe flare, a reason this decision deserves a direct conversation with a dermatologist rather than an assumption that stopping medication is automatically the safer choice.",

    teaser: 'A meta-analysis found light smokers nearly twice as likely to have psoriasis as non-smokers, heavy smokers twice as likely to have severe disease, and smoking also measurably blunts how well biologic treatment actually works.',
    summary: "Smoking has a well-documented, dose-dependent relationship with psoriasis, meaning the effect scales directly with how much and how long someone smokes rather than being a simple yes-or-no risk. A meta-analysis of 25 case-control studies found people smoking just 1 to 14 cigarettes a day were almost twice as likely to have psoriasis as non-smokers, and people smoking 20 or more cigarettes a day had roughly twice the risk of the more severe form of the disease. The proposed mechanism involves polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other compounds in tobacco smoke interfering with a specific signaling pathway (the aryl hydrocarbon receptor) already known to help regulate the skin's barrier function, oxidative stress response, and inflammation. Important beyond just onset risk: a prospective study following patients through biologic treatment found non-smokers had close to three times higher odds of reaching a strong treatment response (PASI 75) at 48 weeks compared to smokers, with earlier smoking start, longer duration, and higher intensity all independently tracking with a worse treatment outcome. A separate, Mendelian randomization study did find smoking an independent, but not clearly causal, risk factor for moderate-to-severe psoriasis specifically, a distinction worth keeping in view rather than overstating. The already-built alcohol and Mediterranean-diet research for psoriasis both point toward lifestyle as a meaningful lever here, and smoking cessation is a concrete addition to that same lever, with a documented effect on treatment response itself, not just disease onset.",

    summary:
      "IL-23 inhibitors (guselkumab, risankizumab, and related medications) are a newer class of biologic treatment, targeting a specific inflammatory signal (interleukin-23) sitting further upstream in psoriasis's inflammatory cascade than older biologic classes. A large phase III trial (VOYAGE 1, over 800 patients) found 73.3% of patients on guselkumab reached PASI 90, meaning 90% clearance of visible psoriasis, at 16 weeks, compared with just 2.9% on placebo and 49.7% on adalimumab, an older, still widely used biologic. Guselkumab's advantage over adalimumab held up and even widened through the full first year of continuous treatment (80.2% versus 53% at week 24). A separate trial (VOYAGE 2) found broadly similar results, and also found that stopping treatment led response to fade over time, while restarting it after a break brought clearance rates back up within weeks. Complete or near-complete skin clearance (PASI 90 or higher) is now a realistic treatment goal for many people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, not the more modest PASI 75 target that used to define a strong response, and this newer medication class is a concrete reason that goal has shifted upward.",

    summary: "Psoriasis carries a distinctive trait: physical trauma to otherwise-unaffected skin can trigger a new patch of psoriasis at the exact site of the injury, appearing clinically and even under a microscope identical to the person's existing disease. This is a named, well-documented pattern called the Koebner phenomenon, and research has documented it following a wide range of triggers: tattoos, surgical incisions, sunburn, skin infections, and even simple scratches or friction. The mechanism isn't fully mapped, but research points to a cascade of local inflammatory signals released at the site of injury (including some of the same immune messengers covered in the psoriasis research, IL-17 and related cytokines), alongside changes in local growth factors and skin-barrier proteins. This phenomenon is a documented reason someone with psoriasis might reasonably want to be more cautious about elective skin trauma, a new tattoo or piercing in particular, during a period of active or poorly controlled disease, since the same injury that would heal cleanly in someone without psoriasis carries an above-average chance of becoming a new, permanent patch instead.",

Research finds PsA affects roughly one in five people with psoriasis, with an incidence around 4.3% per year in some studied populations, meaning skin psoriasis isn't 'just skin' for a substantial minority. Identified predictors of who's more likely to progress include obesity, nail pitting, joint pain without confirmed arthritis (arthralgia), and eye inflammation (uveitis), a checkable list for anyone tracking their psoriasis. The urgent, practical part: research finds diagnosing PsA within 12 months of the first joint symptom defines a 'early PsA' window with measurably better long-term outcomes, while a diagnostic delay of just 6 months can already allow permanent joint erosion and physical function loss to begin. Any new joint pain, stiffness, or swelling in someone with psoriasis, even mild or intermittent, is worth raising specifically and promptly rather than assumed to be ordinary aging or unrelated strain, given how narrow this window for the best long-term joint outcome actually is.",

Research identifies younger age and more severe skin disease as particular risk factors for suicidality specifically. Existing meta-analyses on this exact question don't all agree, with some finding smaller or less consistent effects depending on study design, a caveat rather than an overstated crisis claim. This elevated mental-health burden is a legitimate reason mental health deserves the same direct, routine attention as skin severity itself in psoriasis care, not an afterthought to physical symptom control.",

    summary:
      "Psoriasis in children often looks and behaves differently than the more familiar adult plaque form, and the clearest example is guttate psoriasis, a distinct variant defined by an acute eruption of many small papules and plaques, typically under a centimeter across, scattered mostly on the trunk and limbs. It is the second most common form of psoriasis in children, after chronic plaque psoriasis, and is often a person's very first presentation of psoriasis at all, sometimes before any other psoriasis diagnosis exists. The specific trigger connects directly to a common childhood infection: guttate psoriasis classically develops 1 to 2 weeks after a streptococcal infection, most often strep throat (tonsillopharyngitis), and up to 80% of people with guttate psoriasis have a documented streptococcal infection shortly before the outbreak. The range of outcomes matters here too: guttate psoriasis can resolve on its own or with treatment, but it can also become persistent and progress into the more familiar chronic plaque form. A sudden, widespread outbreak of small, drop-shaped skin spots in a child following a sore throat is a recognizable pattern worth mentioning to a doctor by name, since recognizing guttate psoriasis specifically (rather than assuming a generic rash) can point toward both the right treatment and the right explanation for what triggered it.",

Global burden data confirms this isn't a Norwegian quirk: Western Europe carries the highest age-standardized prevalence rate worldwide (1,155.9 cases per 100,000), while Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa carries the lowest (150.2 per 100,000), and East Asia's prevalence, 0.14%, sits at a small fraction of Australasia's 1.99%. Two distinct factors are named directly in the research: higher latitude itself (less year-round UV exposure) and Caucasian ancestry specifically both independently track with higher rates. For anyone outside North America or Western Europe, a lower reported psoriasis rate in one's home region is a documented pattern, not a sign the condition is being missed or under-diagnosed there, even as the SAME environmental and genetic factors behind it (sun exposure, skin-immune biology) remain worth understanding regardless of where someone lives.",

The complication the study's authors raise directly: they suspect this figure is an UNDERESTIMATE, driven by limited awareness of chronic skin disease and healthcare-access gaps in Greenland specifically, not necessarily true biological rarity, and they call directly for more awareness of chronic skin conditions there. A related finding: psoriasis patients in this same Nuuk cohort had notably higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease (28.6%) than people without psoriasis (20.9%), the same cardiometabolic comorbidity pattern. Greenland's low reported rate is a useful reminder that latitude alone doesn't fully explain psoriasis prevalence: Indigenous genetic background and healthcare-access/awareness gaps can both push a reported rate in either direction.",

The practical advantage: an oral pill without the injection burden or the extensive lab monitoring biologics require.

It received FDA approval in September 2022 specifically for GPP flares, since expanded to more countries worldwide.

A meta-analysis of real-world evidence found substantial variation by year 4: etanercept's survival dropped from 66 percent at year one to 41 percent by year four, infliximab from 61 to 42 percent, adalimumab from 69 to 47 percent, while ustekinumab held up markedly better, from 82 to 56 percent. A separate pooled analysis found 5-year survival rates of 46.3 percent for adalimumab, 35.9 percent for etanercept, and 34.7 percent for infliximab, broadly confirming the same pattern. More recent data adds a useful detail: among biologic-naive patients, ustekinumab showed superior long-term persistence, but newer drugs (bimekizumab, guselkumab, risankizumab) showed higher 2-year survival specifically in patients who had already tried and moved on from an earlier biologic, evidence that the right drug can depend on treatment history, not just which one performed best in an initial trial. The most common reason for stopping etanercept and infliximab was loss of efficacy over time, and infliximab specifically was most often stopped for adverse effects, a practical detail when choosing among the biologic options.",

    teaser: 'A prospective multicenter cohort study found a higher alcohol-misuse screening score directly, significantly predicting a poorer response to systemic psoriasis therapy.',
    summary:
      "The comorbidity research names systemic effects of psoriasis beyond the skin, and research finds alcohol carries a two-way relevance: it worsens disease severity, and it independently predicts worse treatment outcomes. A prospective multicenter cohort study found that a higher score on the CAGE alcohol-screening questionnaire was significantly associated with a poorer response to systemic psoriasis therapies, direct evidence connecting drinking to actual treatment failure, not just symptom severity on its own. An earlier prospective study found a similar, sex-specific pattern: ethanol intake above 80 grams per day before starting treatment was associated with less treatment-induced improvement specifically in men. Research proposes a biologically plausible mechanism, not just a correlation: alcohol affects several of the same neurotransmitter systems (serotonin, dopamine, tachykinin) already implicated in the inflammatory processes driving psoriasis itself. A direct clinical recommendation follows from this: dermatology guidance now names alcohol screening as a worthwhile step (know, screen, intervene) specifically because it can meaningfully change how well an expensive biologic or systemic treatment actually performs. This is actionable information, alcohol use is a modifiable factor worth discussing with a dermatologist, not a moral judgment, specifically because it can directly affect whether an otherwise-effective treatment actually works.",

A Phase IIb clinical trial tested 16:8 time-restricted intermittent fasting specifically for chronic plaque psoriasis, and found a statistically significant reduction in PASI score (the same severity measure) by 28 weeks, alongside measured improvements in quality of life (DLQI) and inflammatory markers (VEGF, hs-CRP), evidence the benefit reaches beyond skin appearance alone into the same systemic inflammation this category's comorbidity research covers. A separate trial testing 5:2 modified intermittent fasting (500 calories on two non-consecutive days weekly) found a significant reduction specifically in scaling and skin thickness among patients with mild psoriasis. An additional study of 108 patients found fasting during Ramadan specifically producing a significant PASI reduction too, a different real-world fasting pattern reaching a similar result. This is useful, structured guidance beyond the general weight-loss recommendation, a specific, testable protocol (16:8 time-restricted eating) worth discussing directly with a doctor as an evidence-backed complement to medical treatment, not a replacement for it.",

    summary:
      "The guttate psoriasis entry names one specific pediatric trigger (a preceding strep infection), and broader prevalence data finds childhood-onset psoriasis common well beyond that one subtype: research finds roughly a third of all psoriasis cases beginning during childhood, with prevalence climbing steadily and linearly with age, from 0.55 percent in UK children ages 0-9 up to 1.37 percent by ages 10-19, and a similar pattern (0.12 percent at age 1 rising to 1.2 percent by age 18) found in German data too, with girls affected somewhat more often than boys. Research finds a meaningful minority, 10 to 20 percent of pediatric psoriasis cases, reaching moderate-to-severe severity requiring systemic treatment, not just topical management. The useful, practical finding: direct pediatric trials now support a growing set of biologic treatments specifically approved for children and adolescents, with etanercept the most studied to date, and adalimumab and ustekinumab also approved options, research finding high efficacy with a favorable safety profile in this specific age group, not simply adult treatments used off-label with unknown pediatric risk.

      "The PASI severity staging measures skin disease specifically, and psoriatic arthritis, the joint-involving complication, has its separate, formal diagnostic tool: the ClASsification for Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR) criteria. Large, multinational prospective validation found CASPAR carrying a sensitivity of 91.4 percent and specificity of 98.7 percent, strong diagnostic accuracy by any clinical standard. Follow-up studies confirm this holds up well even in early disease specifically, the hardest diagnostic window, with one study finding 87.4 percent sensitivity for early psoriatic arthritis, meaningfully outperforming the older Moll and Wright criteria it replaced (80.2 percent). CASPAR works by scoring a combination of features, including current or past psoriasis, nail changes, a negative rheumatoid factor test, dactylitis (characteristic 'sausage digit' swelling), and evidence of new bone formation near a joint on imaging, rather than relying on any single test alone. Since the psoriatic arthritis progression research names a narrow 12-month early-detection window that changes long-term joint outcomes, knowing this accurate, named diagnostic tool exists is worth asking about directly the moment joint symptoms appear alongside psoriasis, rather than waiting for a vaguer clinical impression to form.",

    summary:
      "The treatment research spans diet, biologics, and systemic drugs, and phototherapy, controlled medical exposure to narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) light, is a distinct, effective option worth separate coverage. Pooled data across studies finds narrowband UVB achieving a 75 percent reduction in psoriasis severity (PASI75) in roughly 70 to 81 percent of treated patients, with a meaningful 41 percent reaching a deeper PASI90 clearance. The useful finding for anyone weighing this option: how completely the skin clears directly predicts how long the improvement lasts. Research found a median time to relapse of 6 months for patients who reached PASI90, compared with just 4 months for those who cleared less completely, direct evidence that pushing for a fuller course of treatment pays off in longer remission, not just a better-looking finish. A separate, counterintuitive finding: achieving full PASI100 clearance did not extend remission any further than PASI90, suggesting a practical point of diminishing returns. Identified predictors of a shorter remission include age 60 or older, having used a systemic medication within the past 6 months, and needing three or more phototherapy cycles. Phototherapy is an effective, medication-free option, with concrete expectations about both how well it's likely to work and roughly how long the benefit should last.",

      "The IL-23 inhibitor research names strong efficacy for psoriasis specifically, and research finds the underlying reason connects directly to a completely different condition already built out elsewhere in this app: inflammatory bowel disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified shared genetic susceptibility loci between psoriasis and IBD, including specific genes (IL23R, IL12B, TNFSF15, STAT3) implicated in both diseases independently. The unifying mechanism is the IL-23/Th17 immune pathway, the same pathway, driving keratinocyte overgrowth (the root cause of psoriasis's visible skin plaques) in the skin and direct tissue damage in the gut wall in IBD, two very different-looking diseases sharing one common immune root. This isn't just theoretical: meta-analyses and everyday clinical practice find drugs targeting the IL-17/IL-23 pathway achieving superior skin clearance for psoriasis compared to older TNF-alpha-targeting drugs, practical confirmation that this specific pathway is a central driver, not one of several equally important ones. This shared biology is a reason someone with psoriasis experiencing new digestive symptoms, or someone with IBD noticing new skin plaques, is worth mentioning both conditions together to a doctor rather than treating them as two unrelated, coincidental diagnoses.",

A large pharmacovigilance safety-database analysis backed this up further, finding no increased teratogenic risk and no increased fetal death risk compared to the general population, with miscarriage rates (8.9 to 15.3 percent) and birth-defect rates (3 to 4 percent) for this drug class overall comparable to the general population baseline.

      "Stopping corticosteroids abruptly, whether topical creams or systemic pills, is widely discussed online as a trigger for a severe rebound flare worse than the original psoriasis, and research finds this a complicated, only partly-settled question, not something to repeat uncritically. Clinical distinction exists between two related but different phenomena: tachyphylaxis (a topical steroid losing effectiveness with continued, extended use) and topical steroid withdrawal (a cutaneous reaction appearing specifically after stopping), with several proposed mechanisms for the latter, including dysregulated cortisol production and rebound inflammatory cytokine release from a disrupted skin barrier, none of them yet definitively confirmed. The most important, directly relevant finding: a systematic review and meta-analysis specifically examining rebound psoriasis flares following systemic corticosteroid exposure and withdrawal found the evidence supporting this widely-repeated belief lacking, and called directly for higher-quality studies before the claim can be treated as settled fact. Despite extensive patient discussion and shared experience online, rigorous scientific literature on this specific topic remains scarce, and the current answer is that it's a plausible phenomenon that hasn't yet been adequately studied, not a myth and not a proven mechanism either, worth discussing any steroid tapering plan directly with a dermatologist rather than either dismissing the concern or treating it as settled science.",

One specific clock gene, F3, is significantly reduced in psoriasis and interacts directly with the IL-17 signaling pathway, the same inflammatory pathway targeted by several major psoriasis biologic drugs, low F3 appears to upregulate IL-17 receptor signaling, promoting the keratinocyte inflammation that drives visible plaques. Clinically, this lines up with something people with psoriasis already notice: flares and itch tend to be worse in the evening and overnight, and disrupted peripheral clock function is plausibly connected to the hyperproliferation of skin cells and immune dysregulation that define the disease. Chronotherapy, timing topical or systemic treatment to this rhythm, is an active area of research, not yet a standard part of psoriasis care.",

    summary:
      "Psoriasis is easier to assess than most conditions here, because severity is scored on the skin with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index rather than asked about. That should make trials cleaner, and the results are still a mess. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for psoriasis vulgaris identified six eligible studies covering 522 participants and could not perform a meta-analysis at all, because the interventions, comparators, and reported outcomes differed too much to combine. Single studies produced conflicting results on PASI reduction, on lesion reduction measured other ways, on PASI score, and on relapse rate. A later review of acupuncture-related techniques pooled 13 trials with 1,060 participants and described their methodological quality as not rigorous. Against that, one older trial deserves naming because it is the closest thing here to a clean test: a controlled trial of acupuncture in psoriasis published in Acta Dermato-Venereologica in 1997, whose title reads: no convincing effect. When the pooled body of work cannot be combined and the study with the tightest design finds nothing, the fair summary is that this has not been shown to work rather than that opinion is divided. Psoriasis has treatments that reliably clear skin, from topicals through phototherapy to biologics, and it is also a systemic inflammatory condition that raises cardiovascular risk, so leaving it undertreated costs more than clear skin.",
