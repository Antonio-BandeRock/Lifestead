//
// 2026-08-02, explicitly reconsidered for this builder (a genuinely

// the MASS unit (grams vs. ounces/pounds -- genuinely tied to which scale
// is in use) still follows the profile system. lib/unitConversion.ts's own

//

// generic 'Fried', 2026-07-29 -- explicitly flagged as nutritionally
// meaningfully different for a Hashimoto's person, not just a wording

// more oil-oxidation/degradation byproducts than shallow pan-frying --

// score_food_tiers_v3_reconstructed.py). 'Sautéed' and 'Stir-fried' stay
// their own separate options too (both already distinct real techniques,

// CUT_PREP_METHODS' own "Whole" note below: the field is labeled "Cook
// Prep", so "Raw" already means "not cooked", and the longer form was
// setting this whole column's width single-handedly.
//

// not-yet-chosen placeholder, which only ever shows on the closed field
// itself before anything is picked -- see that file's own comment) -- for
// foods where the question itself doesn't apply, e.g. olive oil has no

// constrain each other.
//
// It matters nutritionally, not just for recipe fidelity, which is why it
// earns a structured field rather than living in the free-text note.
// Cutting ruptures cell walls and exposes interior surface to oxygen: the
// finer the cut, the faster oxidation and the greater the loss of
// air/light-sensitive nutrients (vitamin C, folate) before the food is
// even eaten. It also drives the app's own D-dimension concerns directly --
// crushing/mincing alliums (garlic, onion) activates alliinase and forms
// the sulfur compounds those foods are valued for, while finely shredding
// raw cruciferous vegetables increases the myrosinase-driven goitrogen
// release this app already tracks for thyroid interference.

//
// The in-progress fermentation (fermentationName/servings/ingredients/etc.) is local
// component state only, same as before -- a fermentation isn't a real, saved
// record until Save & Finish Fermentation actually commits it (see finishFermentation/
// saveFermentation in lib/db.ts, 2026-08-01). Navigating away from a fermentation mid-
// build still loses it; that's still a known, accepted gap, just a
// narrower one now that finishing a fermentation for real is possible.
//
// 2026-07-28: every AppTextInput here previews a new app-wide input-box
// treatment (background = constants/colors.ts's own `inputBackground`,

// distinction from plain read-only text anywhere in the app before this.
// Deliberately landed here first, on this one screen, so the lightness/
// alpha recipe (both tunable in one place, `inputBackground`'s own
// constants) can be reviewed and adjusted before rolling it out to every
// other AppTextInput call site.
//
// 2026-07-28, a second pass: this screen's own in-page title bar
// ("Fermentation Builder") was removed -- PageIdentityLabel's own bottom-
// corner box already names whichever builder is open, so repeating it
// here was pure duplication eating screen space for nothing. In its
// place, once Fermentation Name/Servings/Size is confirmed, that form splits into
// a compact two-column summary card (fermentation info on the left, a scrollable
// ingredient list on the right) that then connects directly (flush, square
// corners at the seam) to FoodLookup's own Category/Food picker below it
// -- the picker shows automatically the instant there's no ingredient
// currently pending confirmation, rather than needing an explicit "+ Add
// Ingredient" tap first the way this used to work.
// Created 2026-08-02 by directly adapting SideBuilder.tsx (the Food tab's
// first fully-built builder and the proven, on-device-tested pattern every
// builder is meant to follow -- see CLAUDE.md's Food tab section), the same
// base Side Builder itself used, rather than Salad/Smoothie -- neither of
// those two builders' own raw-goitrogenic-load warning applies here (that
// concern is specifically about eating a large RAW quantity of cruciferous
// vegetables at once; it isn't what this builder's own placeholder copy in
// app/(tabs)/food.tsx describes). The comments below that carry earlier
// 2026-07-xx dates describe reasoning SideBuilder itself arrived at through
// real iteration -- inherited here as still-accurate design reasoning, not
// a claim that FermentationBuilder went through that same history itself.
//
// Scoped to the same ingredient/ferment-name/servings shape as Side
// Builder, plus one real addition, 2026-08-14: a Cultures & Probiotics
// picker (see fermentationStrains/selectedStrainIds below), letting this
// builder record which of a real, cited set of bacterial strains
// (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, Bifidobacterium species,
// Streptococcus thermophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Leuconostoc
// mesenteroides, Saccharomyces boulardii) a saved batch actually used --
// see lib/db.ts's own "Real, specific bacterial-strain tracking" comment
// block and scripts/add_fermentation_strains.py for the full reference-data
// story. The one other concrete, buildable difference from Side Builder:
// 'Fermented' added to this file's own COOKING_METHODS list (see that
// constant's own comment) so the prep step that actually defines a
// fermented food has a real answer to select, which the inherited list
// didn't have at all.
//
// 2026-08-21, real, direct correction: "Fermentation should ask what type
// of fermentation they want to build before moving on to any part of the
// rest of the builder... The bacterias and probiotics selections do not
// belong here at all. Those are ingredients for a yogurt fermentation,
// and that is how they should be treated." FermentationSubtypePicker.tsx
// (a direct mirror of BeverageSubtypePicker.tsx's own already-shipped
// pattern) now runs before this builder ever mounts for a genuinely fresh
// arrival -- app/(tabs)/food.tsx's own render switch handles that, same
// bypass logic as Beverage for editing/reusing something with its own
// already-real ingredients. `subtype` below narrows allowedCategories to
// match, and gates the Cultures & Probiotics section (still built exactly
// as it was) to milkKefirYogurt only, the one real subtype that section
// actually describes -- every other subtype's own real culture (a SCOBY,
// kefir grains, wild yeast on a fruit skin) isn't one of this app's own 7
// catalogued single-organism strains, so showing the picker there would
// misrepresent what's actually fermenting.
// 2026-08-21, same day, real follow-up correction: "I think the types of
// fermentations need to be first divided by if they are a drink or not,
// and then by the type of fermentation inside of the group they chose."
// See FermentationSubtypePicker.tsx's own header comment for the full
// story -- the flat 5-option version below was replaced by a real
// two-step Drink/Food split, 10 real leaf keys total. Cultures &
// Probiotics is now gated to 'yogurt' specifically, not any broader
// dairy grouping -- milk kefir's own culture (kefir grains, a multi-
// species community) was never one of this app's 7 catalogued single-
// organism strains either, the same honest "leave it unlinked" precedent
// this whole recipe set already established, so showing the picker for
// milk kefir would misrepresent what's actually fermenting the same way
// showing it for kombucha would.

  // Servings/Size/Units all use this -- see the JSX comment above them for
  // why three equal flex columns replaced two fixed widths plus a
  // remainder.
  // sizeLabelRow / scrollHint / sizeInputGroup / amountPicker lived here
  // until 2026-07-31 -- they laid out the per-ingredient Quantity and
  // Units pickers side by side under a shared label row. That whole shape
  // was replaced by four stacked, individually-labeled fields
  // (renderLabeledPicker), leaving these with no callers, so they were
  // removed rather than left as dead styles.

  // The unit/amount pills sit inline beside their own sibling (unit next
  // to the amount picker, or Servings alone in its own row), 2026-07-28,
  // as a scrollable box (vertical since 2026-07-29, see renderPillPicker's
  // own comment) so every option stays reachable without needing to grow
  // wider. Bordered -- a plain unbounded
  // ScrollView butted right up against its sibling had nothing marking
  // where one ends and the other begins. Same colors.border/borderRadius
  // recipe as formInput's own outline (below), so this reads as matching
  // form chrome. Background is applied inline at the render site instead
  // of here, matching every input's own backgroundColor -- both need the
  // live tabColor prop to compute (inputBackground(tabColor)), which a
  // static StyleSheet object has no access to.
  //
  // Deliberately has no width/flex of its own -- renderPillPicker always
  // pairs this with EITHER a fixed-width style (servingsPicker/
  // amountPicker) OR pillScrollFlex below, never both at once (flex: 1
  // implies flexBasis: 0%, which would silently win over an explicit
  // width set alongside it, undoing the fixed width entirely).
  // The ScrollView inside spans this box's FULL size, 2026-07-28 (see
  // renderPillPicker's own "fourth pass" comment for why) -- the two
  // scrollArrowBadge indicators are an absolute overlay on top of it, not
  // separate flex siblings, so a drag starting anywhere in this box,
  // including visually on top of a badge, still reaches the ScrollView
  // underneath and scrolls it. overflow: 'hidden' keeps the ScrollView's
  // own content clipped to this box's rounded corners, same reasoning as
  // InlineSelectList.tsx's own container.
  //
  // height added 2026-07-29 (the fifth-pass switch to vertical scrolling,
  // see renderPillPicker's own comment) -- a ScrollView needs a bounded
  // cross-axis size to actually scroll rather than just growing to fit
  // its content; the old horizontal version got this for free from the
  // row's own width, but a vertical one needs it stated explicitly.
  // Picked to comfortably show about two pills at rest with a clear peek
  // of a third -- enough to read as "a short scrollable list," not so
  // tall it dominates the Servings/Size/Units row it sits in. Tune
  // on-device if it reads too cramped or too tall in practice.
  // The unit picker's own sizing -- fills exactly whatever width its row
  // has left after its sibling's own fixed width (Servings, or the amount
  // picker beside it); height now comes from pillScroll's own fixed
  // height above regardless of how much content there is to scroll.
  // paddingVertical widened 2026-07-29 (was paddingHorizontal, back when
  // this scrolled sideways -- see renderPillPicker's own "fifth pass"
  // comment) so a real pill never scrolls in directly underneath either
  // scrollArrowBadge (a 16px badge inset 2px from the top/bottom edge
  // reaches ~18px in) -- the same reasoning as before, just rotated 90
  // degrees along with the scroll axis. paddingHorizontal shrunk back
  // down since there's no longer a left/right badge to clear.
  // pillRow / pill lived here until 2026-07-31 -- the wrapping chip grid
  // the Cooking Method step used before it became the "Cook Prep"
  // vertical spinner. Every pill in this component now goes through
  // renderPillPicker, so both are gone rather than left unreferenced.

  // The only pill style left, used inside every scrollable pill picker
  // (renderPillPicker). Its shorter paddingVertical (4, vs the 6 the old
  // wrapping `pill` used) came from the 2026-07-28 box-shrinking pass.
  // textAlign matters now that renderLabeledPicker stretches every pill to

  // Holds all four labeled pickers. flexWrap is the whole trick, 2026-07-31:
  // each field takes only the width it actually needs (see
  // renderLabeledPicker), so on a wide screen all four fit across in one
  // line, and on a narrower one they wrap to two-by-two automatically. No
  // breakpoint, no device check, no second layout to maintain -- the row
  // simply uses whatever width the phone gives it.
  //
  // Measured before committing to this, back when these four fields were
  // combination-lock wheels (2026-07-31): with "Whole" and "Raw" trimmed
  // (see CUT_PREP_METHODS/COOKING_METHODS), four across needed ~361px
  // against ~414px before the trim, moving it from "only the largest
  // phones" to "most phones," with graceful wrapping for the rest. Those
  // exact numbers are stale now that the fields are PopoverSelect's own
  // shorter chevron-style boxes (2026-08-01, narrower than a wheel's own
  // fixed frame), but the reasoning -- keep the row's own real width
  // trimmed rather than device-checking a breakpoint -- still holds.
  // space-between lived here 2026-07-31 to 2026-08-01 -- explicitly
  // reverted the same day the fields themselves gained hand-
  // aware reordering (see useReorderedLabeledFields, this file's own
  // top). Spreading fields evenly across the row fought that reordering
  // visually: a field that just slid to the "away" end still needs to
  // read as having moved TOWARD that edge, not as one more evenly-spaced
  // item in an unchanged layout. flex-start packs every field against its
  // neighbours instead, so a reordering field visibly travels somewhere,
  // with columnGap as the only spacing between them. Still composes with
  // flexWrap the same way: each wrapped line packs its own contents
  // independently, and the two-by-two fallback on a narrow screen still
  // reads as one deliberate cluster rather than spread thin.
