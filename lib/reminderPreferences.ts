// Which kinds of reminder are allowed to fire, 2026-09-16.
//
// Until now lib/reminderNotifications.ts had exactly two kinds, doses and
// appointments, and both were on for anyone who granted the permission.
// Meals and hydration join them in the same pass, and they change the
// arithmetic enough that a switch stopped being optional: a day can hold
// three or four meals and, once the Daily Meal Plan has filled a water gap,
// up to six drink reminders on top of whatever doses are already scheduled.
// Sent unasked, that is the fastest way to make someone turn off
// notifications for this app altogether, which would silently take the dose
// reminders with it. So each kind gets its own switch, in Profile >
// Reminders.
//
// Same shape as lib/generalHealthPreferences.ts and lib/visualPreferences.ts
// (one JSON blob under a single app_meta key, a module-level cache and a
// subscriber list so a toggle reaches anything mounted without a restart),
// kept in its own file for the same reason that one is: it changes what the
// app does, not how it looks.
