// What one phone actually sends the other.
//
// Agreed carrier: each person's own OneDrive or Google Drive, set up during
// pairing, with children inheriting the same location. This module is the
// PAYLOAD, deliberately independent of how it travels, so the same bytes work
// over a cloud folder now and over the local network later without being
// rewritten.
//
// THE SHAPE THAT MAKES THIS SMALL. A shared week is not a recipe dump. The
// reference database is bundled and version-stamped identically on both phones,
// so `linkedCuratedRecipeId` is a stable pointer and a day is a handful of short
// strings. That is only true while both sides are on the same reference
// database, which is exactly why the version travels with the payload and why a
// mismatch refuses the plan.
//
// WHAT DOES NOT TRAVEL, EVER. Condition codes and curated recipe ids. Not a
// symptom, not a lab result, not a healing stage, not a note, not a weight. The
// grant vocabulary has said so since partner links shipped, and a test asserts
// it on the text and on the shape rather than trusting the comment.
//
// SENDING ENFORCES THE GRANTS, NOT RECEIVING. What someone grants a partner is
// one-directional and stored on the sender's device, so the sender is the only
// side that can honour it. The receiving side takes absence of data as absence
// of a grant, the same reading lib/partners.ts already documents, which is why
// there is no second set of columns here to disagree with reality.
// WHAT VERSION 2 ADDED, 2026-09-22. A payload used to be a one-way
// statement: here are my conditions, here is my plan, replace what you had.
// Direct instruction the same day: "the communication flow as per what is
// being done between the user's devices needs to be the same kind of
// process that happens between partners, and their children, and where
// applicable, their care giver." So a payload now also carries the records
// of anything the two people hold BETWEEN them, and the receiving side
// merges them rather than replacing, which is what lib/peerMerge.ts does.
//
// The allowlist is applied HERE, on the way out, through tablesToSend.
// That is the same reason the condition list is filtered here rather than
// at a call site: a privacy decision is either enforced in one place or
// hoped for in several. lib/peerRelationships.ts holds the list itself.
//
// A version 1 payload is still read, since the other phone updates when it
// updates and a link that stops working on an app update is worse than one
// that carries less for a week.
