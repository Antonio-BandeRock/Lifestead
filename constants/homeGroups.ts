// The name, icon and colour a Home group and the cards inside it wear.
//
// Lived inside app/(tabs)/index.tsx until 1.0.39.16, which was fine while
// Home was the only screen that drew a group. Profile now lists the same
// groups for its own on/off switches, and a second hand-typed copy of
// "Profile is grey, and Garden's colour comes from TAB_ROUTES" is exactly
// the kind of thing that drifts. So it moved here, next to TAB_ROUTES
// itself, and both screens read the one answer.
//
// Nine of the eleven come straight from TAB_ROUTES, so they can never drift
// from the tab's own. Profile is one exception: TabHub's menu puts it
// second, right after Home, but it is a Stack screen rather than a tab, and
// adding it to TAB_ROUTES would make it a tenth swipeable tab. So its
// identity is stated here, matching TabHub's own tile
// (components/TabHub.tsx, renderProfileTile).
//
// Its colour is the grey TabHub gives Profile at rest, not Profile's pink
// identity colour, 1.0.39.11: "Profile's color can't be pink, or whatever
// color it is. In the TabHub menu, it is a grey color. I think it should
// stay that way on the Home screen." TabHub only reaches for the pink when
// Profile is the tab you are standing on (renderProfileTile), which is
// never true from Home.
//
// That grey works as a mark and fails as a font, 1.0.39.17: "The font for
// Profile group needs to be the same color as that of the Reports group so
// it is readable against the background." menuIconMuted is a mid slate,
// which TabHub can afford because its menu sits on a solid panel, while
// Home lays these bands over a photograph. So the identity carries a
// second colour for its words alone: Reports' near-white, which is the
// lightest thing any tab wears and the one the request named. The accent
// stripe and the icon stay grey, so Profile still reads as Profile.
//
// The Digest is the other, since 2026-09-19. The tab was taken apart that
// day (its reading lives on Life, Garden and Food now), and the flip cards
// on Home spent one release in the Home group before the correction: "they
// need to be out on their own together like they were before, and they
// should be listed in a group called Digest", in the purple the tab wore,
// "since it doesn't exist otherwise." The ribbon went with the tab; the
// newspaper was chosen from four offered (newspaper, book, library,
// bookmarks) because it is the one that says "digest", a periodical of
// short pieces from many subjects, which is what the cards are.
