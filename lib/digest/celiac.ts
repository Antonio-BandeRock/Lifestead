// Celiac is a genuinely different kind of condition from every one built

// the entire treatment -- there is no medication that substitutes for it.
// That changes what "food-friendliness" even means here: the real, hard
// questions aren't which foods help or hurt at the margins, they're how
// much cross-contamination actually matters, whether oats are safe, what
// a gluten-free diet itself gets nutritionally wrong if not managed
// carefully, and how long real healing actually takes.
//
// This app's own Gut & Microbiome category already carries the central
// mechanism (gliadin, zonulin, intestinal permeability) that celiac

    summary: "Celiac disease is an autoimmune reaction to gluten, a protein in wheat, barley, and rye, that damages the lining of the small intestine, specifically the villi responsible for absorbing nutrients. Unlike every other condition built out so far, there's no medication that treats celiac disease itself.\n\nA strict, lifelong gluten-free diet is the entire treatment, which means the practical questions here are different in kind from \"does this food help or hurt at the margins.\" They're about how strict is strict enough, whether trace cross-contamination matters, whether oats are safe, and what a gluten-free diet itself can get nutritionally wrong if it isn't managed carefully. The Gut & Microbiome category covers the underlying mechanism, gliadin, zonulin, and intestinal permeability, research that began with celiac disease as its original population. This category covers what's specific to actually living with and being diagnosed with the disease itself.",

    summary:
      "Celiac disease testing has a specific trap that catches a lot of people: every diagnostic test, from blood antibodies to a biopsy, requires actively eating gluten at the time of testing, and stopping gluten beforehand can cause a false negative within weeks. The standard first test is tTG-IgA (tissue transglutaminase antibody), almost always paired with a total IgA measurement, since IgA deficiency, itself associated with celiac disease, can cause a false negative on the antibody test alone.\n\nEMA (endomysial antibody) is a highly specific confirming test. HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genetic testing can't diagnose celiac disease on its own, since up to 25-30% of the general population carries one or both genes without ever developing the disease, but a negative result on both genes can essentially rule celiac disease out.\n\nA 2025 European guideline confirmed a biopsy remains required for most adult diagnoses, though a very high antibody level combined with a positive EMA and positive genetic result can be enough on its in selected pediatric cases. For anyone who already went gluten-free before ever getting properly tested, a structured \"gluten challenge,\" eating gluten again under medical guidance for long enough to let the antibodies and intestinal changes reappear, is the path to an accurate diagnosis, not a diagnosis assumed from symptom improvement alone.",

    summary:
      "Oats are naturally gluten-free, but the oats-and-celiac-disease question is more complicated than that fact alone suggests, and for two separate reasons. The first is ordinary cross-contamination: oats are frequently grown, harvested, or processed alongside wheat, making contamination a common risk unless a product is specifically certified gluten-free. The second is separate from contamination entirely: oats contain avenin, their gluten-like protein, and a minority of celiac patients react to avenin itself, even in laboratory-confirmed, completely uncontaminated pure oats.\n\nResearch finds pure oats are well-tolerated by most celiac patients at moderate amounts (roughly 20-25 grams a day for children, 50-70 grams for adults), and even in the studies where some patients reacted to purified avenin with symptoms, no actual intestinal damage was found in those reactors, a reassuring, if not fully resolved, detail. Certified gluten-free oats are a reasonable thing to try, but worth introducing carefully and watching for a personal reaction, not assumed universally safe just because they're gluten-free by definition.",

    summary:
      "Going gluten-free is medically necessary for celiac disease, but it isn't automatically a nutritional upgrade, and market research backs that up directly. Comparing gluten-free products against their gluten-containing equivalents found the gluten-free versions running measurably lower in protein and fiber while carrying more saturated fat, sugar, and salt, largely because they're typically built from refined starches rather than whole grains.\n\nBroader nutritional research on the diet extends the concern: adherence to a gluten-free diet is linked to lower fiber intake and documented deficiencies in iron, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and magnesium, made worse by the fact that gluten-free products aren't required to be fortified with these nutrients the way many gluten-containing staples (fortified bread and cereal, for instance) already are. On top of the nutritional gap, market pricing data found gluten-free products running 46% to as much as 443% more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts.\n\nNone of this is a reason to avoid a gluten-free diet, medically necessary for celiac disease regardless.

    summary:
      "Starting a gluten-free diet often brings symptom relief within days to a few weeks, but that's a different timeline from the intestinal lining actually healing underneath. Research on children and younger adults found the small intestine typically fully healed within 3 to 6 months. For older adults, that same healing can take up to 2 years, and a specific finding: research tracking recovery by age found people between 30 and 60 showing measurable but incomplete recovery, while people over 60 showed no statistically significant healing at all in the same studies.\n\nLooking at recovery rates over time rather than by age alone, research found only about 34% of adults reached full mucosal healing within 2 years, rising to about 66% by 5 years, meaning a meaningful share of adults on a strict gluten-free diet still show some persistent villous damage well beyond the timeline most people expect.

Research finds osteopenia or osteoporosis in an estimated 38% to 72% of newly diagnosed patients, with decreased bone mineral density showing up in over half of newly diagnosed adults specifically, driven by the same malabsorption (of calcium and vitamin D, among other nutrients) that damaged villi cause before treatment starts. A specific, actionable recommendation came out of a 2025 study: bone mineral density screening at age 45 for people with celiac disease, given a documented increased risk of lumbar osteoporosis by middle age.\n\nThe encouraging part: in patients confirmed celiac and started on a strict gluten-free diet, bone density measurably responds to treatment as the gut heals and nutrient absorption improves, meaning this isn't a permanent, fixed loss the way some bone-density findings in other conditions can be. Worth asking for a DEXA scan at diagnosis regardless of age, and again around 45 if not already screened, rather than assuming bone health is fine just because nothing hurts yet.",

His 1950 doctoral thesis formally established that removing wheat, rye, and oats produced dramatic improvement, identifying gluten, a specific protein component, as the actual toxic trigger.

The result is an intensely itchy, blistering rash, most classically on the elbows, knees, and buttocks.\n\nResearch finds more than 90% of people with dermatitis herpetiformis also have confirmable gluten-sensitive enteropathy on biopsy, even when they have no digestive symptoms at all, and conversely, a 15-25% of people with celiac disease develop this same skin manifestation at some point. Dermatitis herpetiformis responds to the exact same gluten-free diet covered in the celiac research, with excellent long-term prognosis once gluten is removed, and it's worth raising directly with a doctor as a possible celiac clue for anyone with an unexplained, persistently itchy, blistering rash, since it can be the very first, or only, visible sign of the disease.",

    summary: "Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a distinct condition from celiac disease, someone with symptoms after eating gluten but without the celiac-specific antibodies or intestinal damage covered in the diagnostic-panel and Marsh-staging research, and it remains a contested clinical entity rather than a settled diagnosis.\n\nResearch finds a striking gap between self-report and confirmed cases: approximately 10% of the global population self-reports gluten or wheat sensitivity, but controlled double-blind challenge studies (where neither the patient nor the tester knows whether gluten or a placebo was actually given) find only 16-30% of self-reporting individuals actually react specifically to gluten when properly tested, with research pointing to high nocebo and placebo effects as a major confounding factor.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests gluten may not even be the sole trigger in NCGS, with other wheat components, amylase-trypsin inhibitors, wheat germ agglutinin, and fructans among them, potentially contributing to symptoms independent of gluten itself. NCGS lacks validated diagnostic criteria or a reliable biomarker, unlike celiac disease's testable antibody and biopsy panel, meaning anyone suspecting gluten sensitivity should still be tested for celiac disease FIRST, and while still eating gluten, since a self-directed gluten-free trial before proper testing (the same trap covered in the diagnostic-panel research) can make a true celiac diagnosis much harder to confirm later.",

    summary: "Dental enamel defects are a distinctive and often-overlooked sign of celiac disease in children, sometimes appearing before a child ever shows the more familiar digestive symptoms covered in the celiac research. Studies find these defects in a striking range, 48% to as high as 94.1% of children with celiac disease, compared to a much lower rate in healthy children in the same studies (one pilot study found 83.3% in celiac children versus 53.3% in controls; another found 61.54% versus 21.15%).\n\nResearch finds these defects most commonly appear on deciduous (baby) molars and incisors, often in a symmetric pattern across the mouth, and are most consistently seen in children who developed celiac symptoms before age 7, tied to how tooth enamel actually forms during that same developmental window.\n\nUseful and actionable: clinical research now recommends that dentists specifically screen for celiac disease when they observe this pattern of enamel defects, since the connection is well-documented enough to serve as an early diagnostic clue rather than just a coincidental dental finding. This is a concrete reason for parents of a child with unexplained, symmetric enamel defects, especially alongside any other celiac risk factor like a family history or the Hashimoto's comorbidity covered in the research, to bring it up directly with a doctor rather than treat it as a purely dental issue.",

    summary: "This is a worth-knowing legal gap directly relevant to the gluten-free-diet nutritional pitfalls covered in the celiac research: federal law in the United States requires manufacturers to add folic acid to wheat-based breads, cereals, flours, and pastas, and the UK legally requires wheat flour to be fortified with calcium, iron, niacin, and thiamin, but neither requirement extends to the gluten-free products that replace them.\n\nProduct testing found only 9% of US gluten-free bread products fortified with thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin, iron fortification present in just 23% of gluten-free breads and in NO tested gluten-free pasta products at all. Calcium showed the same gap: gluten-free white loaves averaged 99mg of calcium per 100g compared to 177mg in wheat-based loaves, with only 27% of gluten-free loaves fortified at all versus 100% of standard wheat loaves.\n\nSomeone eating gluten-free isn't just avoiding one ingredient, they're very likely also losing a legally-mandated layer of fortification most people eating regular wheat products get automatically and never think about.

    summary: "Celiac disease carries a substantially elevated mental health burden, not just a byproduct of managing a chronic illness. Meta-analysis data finds people with celiac disease at a 2.26 times higher risk of anxiety and a 3.36 times higher risk of depression compared to the general population. Pediatric research finds this burden shows up early and is underrecognized by caregivers, one study found 39% of children with celiac disease reporting clinically significant anxiety or depression concerns on their self-report, while their caregivers flagged concerns in only 7% (anxiety) and 14% (depression) of the same children, a striking gap between what a child experiences and what a parent perceives.\n\nResearch finds a gluten-free diet associated with lower depression and anxiety overall, but the effect isn't consistent or complete, anxiety symptoms tend to improve more reliably with dietary treatment, while research finds depression often continues even once physical, digestive symptoms have resolved. This biological connection likely runs deeper than just \"living with a chronic illness is hard,\" research increasingly points to direct gut-brain mechanisms (covered in the broader gut-microbiome research).\n\nClinical research explicitly recommends integrating mental healthcare into celiac disease management, not treating it as a separate, unrelated concern, someone with celiac disease experiencing persistent low mood or anxiety, even after successfully going gluten-free, has an evidence-backed reason to seek dedicated mental health support alongside their dietary treatment.",

Research finds the estimated ratio of diagnosed to undiagnosed cases running anywhere from 1:5 to 1:8, meaning for every person with a confirmed celiac diagnosis, research suggests 5 to 8 more people may have the disease without knowing it.\n\nThe primary reason: only 10-20% of people with celiac disease show the classic, fully developed digestive symptoms most people associate with the condition, research finds the majority have atypical symptoms (like the iron-deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, or infertility covered in the celiac research), only mild symptoms, or none at all. This connects directly to the concept of \"silent\" celiac disease, confirmed cases (positive antibodies, intestinal damage on biopsy) with no noticeable symptoms at all, often only discovered through screening a family member of someone already diagnosed, since celiac disease's established genetic and familial risk makes this a worthwhile screening trigger.\n\nThis is important context for anyone with a family member diagnosed with celiac disease, or anyone with unexplained, atypical symptoms like persistent fatigue, anemia, or low bone density, testing (covered in the diagnostic-panel research) is worth pursuing even without classic digestive symptoms, since the visible cases may be the minority.",

    summary: "Getting an accurate celiac disease test requires a specific amount of gluten intake beforehand: going gluten-free too early, even briefly, is the single most common reason for a false-negative celiac test result already implied elsewhere in the diagnostic-panel research. Medical guidance recommends consuming 3 to 10 grams of gluten per day, roughly equivalent to 1.5 to 2 slices of ordinary wheat bread, for a specific duration of 6 to 8 weeks before blood antibody testing, giving the body enough time to reactivate the autoimmune antibody response the test is actually looking for.\n\nResearch finds a shorter gluten challenge, at least 2 weeks, generally sufficient before an endoscopy/biopsy specifically, since that test looks directly at intestinal tissue damage rather than relying on the slower antibody response blood testing depends on. Guidance finds a gluten challenge is NOT recommended before age 5, during puberty, or during pregnancy, since research finds gluten intake during these periods can affect nutrient absorption in ways that risk contributing to growth or pregnancy complications.\n\nAnyone who has already reduced or eliminated gluten before ever being tested, a common and understandable reaction to feeling unwell, needs this specific reintroduction protocol before a test result can be trusted either way, working with a doctor to plan the challenge safely rather than either avoiding testing altogether or assuming a test taken after already cutting gluten is accurate.",

Identified risk factors include poor adherence to a gluten-free diet, a specific genetic profile (HLA-DQ2 homozygosity), and a late diagnosis, all pointing toward the same practical conclusion: evidence finds sticking to the diet itself measurably lowers the odds of this complication developing.\n\nEATL itself carries a serious prognosis once it does develop, and diagnosing it can be difficult, since the exact same red flags (weight loss, abdominal pain, diarrhea returning despite a strict diet) can also just mean the diet itself has slipped or another condition has been missed.

Seroprevalence data confirms the pattern in practice: the Middle East (1.4%) and South Asia (1.2%) both run measurably higher than East Asia (0.06%), and celiac disease is rare in the Far East and sub-Saharan Africa, where wheat and other gluten grains have also never been dietary staples the way they are further west.\n\nCeliac disease being reported as rare in a given home region can reflect a difference in inherited genetic risk and traditional diet, not necessarily under-diagnosis, though rising wheat consumption in newly-Westernizing diets is a separate factor worth watching in any population regardless of its baseline genetic risk.",

ZED1227, described in research as the leading candidate in its drug class, blocks the specific enzyme (transglutaminase 2) that gluten triggers to cause intestinal damage in celiac disease, and a randomized trial found it measurably reduced gluten-induced gut injury at every dose tested. It's now moving through larger Phase 2b/3 trials expected to report through 2026-2027.\n\nA second, different candidate, TAK-101, works through a different mechanism (training the immune system toward tolerance rather than blocking an enzyme) and showed a striking 88% reduction in the gluten-triggered immune signal that drives symptoms in early testing, though its most recent Phase 2 trial found the difference in actual intestinal healing didn't reach statistical significance, a result that sits alongside the more flattering number above. Neither drug is intended to replace this category's primary treatment (strict gluten avoidance), both are being developed as a safety buffer against accidental exposure, not permission to eat gluten again.",

    summary:
      "Published research finds a counterintuitive pattern: celiac disease patients show LOWER rates of hypertension than matched controls (15.2 percent versus 26.7 percent in one study), and research more broadly finds celiac patients carry a lower prevalence of several traditional cardiac risk factors at once, hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking, and obesity all included. This makes the separate finding sitting right alongside it surprising: despite this favorable traditional-risk-factor profile, large studies still find celiac disease associated with a measurably higher risk of overall cardiovascular disease, including a 1.5-fold higher hazard of ischemic heart disease and 1.59-fold higher risk of heart attack specifically.\n\nThe proposed explanation is a different mechanism than the usual hypertension/cholesterol story: research points to a gut-to-cardiovascular inflammatory pathway, involving immune cell activity and a specific inflammatory signaling molecule (IL-17A) tied directly to active, untreated celiac disease, and research finds this same cardiovascular risk measurably reversible with a gluten-free diet, a direct, food-first reason strict dietary adherence matters for the heart, not just the gut.",

An IBS overlap explains a meaningful share of this: research places IBS prevalence in celiac patients at 22%, against a 4-11% background rate in the general population, with over a third of celiac patients showing IBS-LIKE altered gut motility even without a formal IBS diagnosis.\n\nThe practical answer the already-cited low-FODMAP research covers: systematic review evidence supports a low-FODMAP approach specifically for celiac patients with these persistent, IBS-like symptoms after their gluten-free diet is already confirmed strict and adequate.

      "The villi-healing research assumes a strict gluten-free diet eventually resolves the disease, and for the overwhelming majority it does. A small minority, roughly 1 percent of celiac patients, develops refractory celiac disease (RCD), persistent villous atrophy and symptoms despite at least 12 months of confirmed, strict dietary adherence.\n\nPathology splits RCD into two distinct types: Type I shows a normal, polyclonal population of the gut's immune cells, while Type II shows an abnormal, monoclonal (single-lineage) expansion of those same cells, a distinguishing lab finding, not just a severity label. The worth-knowing difference is prognosis: a Mayo Clinic cohort study found 5-year survival at 80 percent for Type I versus a markedly lower 45 percent for Type II, with the excess mortality in Type II driven mainly by a serious complication, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.\n\nClinical data also finds Type II presenting with more severe features across the board, including diarrhea, anemia, and low blood protein, at higher rates than Type I. This is rare, and serious territory that needs a gastroenterologist's direct involvement, not something to self-diagnose from persistent symptoms alone, since far more common explanations (unintentional gluten exposure, the IBS-overlap) explain the vast majority of ongoing symptoms.",

A meta-analysis confirmed this pattern held across multiple studies, and a longitudinal study found bone mineral content, bone area, and density all significantly low at diagnosis but normal after treatment.\n\nThe one condition attached: research found the degree of recovery statistically tied to how strictly the gluten-free diet was actually followed, and separately emphasized that early diagnosis specifically matters, since achieving adequate peak bone mass by the end of puberty is a one-time developmental window that doesn't reopen later.

Smaller studies do find measurable sperm abnormalities in men with untreated celiac disease, including significantly impaired sperm chromatin maturation (persistent histones and protamine deficiency, both markers of sperm-DNA packaging quality), plausibly linked to nutrient deficiencies this condition can cause, particularly selenium and zinc, both directly involved in sperm development.\n\nBut the most decisive evidence comes from a much larger, nationwide Swedish population-based cohort of 7,121 men with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease (villous atrophy), which found an overall fertility hazard ratio of 1.02, essentially no meaningful difference from men without celiac disease. Separate research directly titled the underlying question 'fact or fiction' found the broader literature conflicting: some smaller studies report higher infertility rates in celiac patients, others find no such association at all. Rather than picking whichever finding sounds more dramatic, the best, largest, population-level evidence currently available does not support a meaningful male-fertility risk from celiac disease itself, even though measurable sperm-parameter changes can occur, a useful distinction between a detectable biological signal and an actual, population-level fertility outcome.",
