- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** Saving a meal offers to take what it used off Life > Kitchen, the way offerGardenUse does for the garden; only matching units are taken off and the rest said so; running low goes to the grocery list in one tap. Builds on H1 and H2. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f272814f94a7f6deb88695fe

- **Answers:** (your question) · **Theme:** Brainstorm review 2026-10-06
- **How:** The person picks what goes in (usually K4's visit page); the doctor opens a link on insidestoryapp.com with a code and it decrypts on their screen, the Worker never seeing the contents. Expires after the appointment by default and can be withdrawn sooner, saying plainly it cannot reach a copy the doctor saved; offers a PDF for the portal or chart. No install or account for the doctor. Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/3f153652f27281e590c9fe4cad6ce01b

Ingest and map them in the unified database, carry them across in Phase 5, and only then reach the live file through the swap; never by hand on foods_reference.db. Every Insights and Trends nutrient band reads them with no further change once the code list grows.

- **How:** Grow from 496 by cited sets per condition and per season, and by people: a checked recipe shared as a .is file goes into the receiver's library already scored. A recipe API is a per-call charge and AI generation sends data away, so neither is the route.

- **Ships by:** Over the air (JS) · **Size:** M · **Tabs:** Schedules,Life
- **Answers:** Fitbod · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Offer the gentler alternative when the check-in reads low or a flare is open, and step a strength workout up from its logged sets, so the plan progresses and also holds back.

### Q19. Cycle shared with a partner by choice

- **Answers:** Nerva, Calm · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
- **How:** Scripts for flare nights, pain and waiting for results written per condition, the trial-backed programmes (gut-directed hypnotherapy, CBT for IBS) named with how to reach them in the condition reading, and the person’s own recordings played once R1 carries expo-audio.

### Q23. A three-day bladder diary

- **How:** A plain entry for every common marker in the lab list: what it measures, what moves it up or down (food, supplements, medicines, timing of the draw), which of the 19 conditions watch it, with an evidence tier and source, opened on tap from any result.

- **Answers:** Ecowitt · **Theme:** Beating the leader, function by function (2026-10-07)
