// "Say What You Ate" -- quick-log phase 3, 2026-08-30 (Open Next Steps item
// 21). Speak a meal, see exactly what the app worked out, correct anything
// wrong, then log it.
//
// Why this exists: logging discipline is this project's named #1 risk, and
// phases 1 and 2 only cover food the app has already seen (a meal logged
// before, a product with a barcode). Speaking is the one input that covers
// anything else without opening a builder.
//
// 2026-08-30, direct steer on what that "anything else" actually is in
// practice: "Say what you ate should be related to eating out at a restaurant
// OR if you went off of the scheduled meal, this would be an easy and quick
// way to replace it." Correct, and it is the case with the least chance of
// ever being logged otherwise -- a restaurant plate has no barcode, no recipe
// and no saved record anywhere, and a meal eaten instead of a planned one
// leaves the planned one sitting unresolved forever. So this screen also
// offers today's still-planned meals to replace, and a way to mark a meal as
// eaten out, rather than being a generic dictation box that happens to log
// food.
//
// Two rules shape the whole screen:
//
//   1. Nothing is ever logged from speech alone. A recognizer returns literal
//      words with no idea what a food is, and lib/quickLog.ts's parser is a
//      deliberately small vocabulary on top of that. Both are good enough to
//      make a proposal and nowhere near good enough to be trusted silently, so
//      every amount and every matched food is shown and editable first.
//
//   2. An amount that cannot honestly be resolved says so instead of guessing.
//      "A cup of rice" has no weight the app can work out (see
//      estimateGramsForFood in lib/db.ts), and quietly assuming one would put a
//      number nobody chose into the record and then into every trend built on
//      it. Those rows are flagged and excluded until a weight is given.
