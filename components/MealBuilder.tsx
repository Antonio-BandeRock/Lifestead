// Deliberately last of the ten Food-tab builders, per this app's own build
// order (see CLAUDE.md's Next steps) -- this is the only one that assembles
// FROM the other nine's own saved output instead of building its own from
// raw ingredients, so it couldn't exist until they did. See the published
// design doc (linked from CLAUDE.md's Status section) for the full
// pipeline/schema reasoning; this file is Phase 2+4 of that doc's own
// 4-phase build sequence -- assemble a meal from saved sides/salads/etc and
// log it now, plus reconnect Schedule's/Home's "Log now" deep link, which
// has pointed at a dead end since the old all-in-one meal builder was
// deleted 2026-07-25. Phase 3 ("Save & Schedule for later," a convenience
// shortcut distinct from fixing that deep link) is deliberately deferred --
// Schedule already has its own independent "schedule a meal" flow that
// doesn't require Meal Builder at all, so this isn't a hard gap the way the
// Log Now dead end was.
//
// 2026-09-13: a meal is no longer assembled only from what the person has
// built. Every "Add from..." category lists the system recipes of that
// builder alongside the person's own saved dishes (a system pick becomes a
// hidden carrier record the moment it is confirmed, see
// materializeCuratedRecipeAsMealComponent in lib/db.ts), and "Start from a
// meal you have" loads a meal favorite, a meal on the schedule, or a past
// logged meal as the starting point. The old "nothing to build from yet"
// gate is gone with it: there is always something to build from now.
//

// here rather than importing across screen files, same precedent already
// used elsewhere in this app (e.g. SideBuilder's own COOKING_METHODS).
