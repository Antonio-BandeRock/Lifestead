// Glossary -- added 2026-08-07, direct request: "Provide a glossary of
// words and phrases and acronyms and definitions of all of them and what
// they are, and what they do for the body and how they tie in to
// Hashimoto's... make it the first one at the top left."
//
// A different kind of category from the other 15: every other one is meant
// to be read start to finish, building toward a real payoff. This one is
// meant to be looked something up in, in isolation, the way a dictionary
// or glossary works, so each entry here is deliberately short and
// self-contained (a definition, what it does in the body, how it connects
// to Hashimoto's or this app's own research) rather than a full
// beginning-middle-end story. That's a considered exception to this
// session's own narrative-rewrite direction, not an oversight: a glossary
// entry's whole job is to be found fast and understood in one read, not to
// build suspense.
//
// 57 terms, sorted alphabetically by their own title (the standard,
// most-findable order for a glossary) rather than grouped by theme,
// deliberately not organized by category, since someone looking up "TSH"
// shouldn't have to guess whether it lives under "Thyroid" or "Labs"
// first. Every term that already has a cited source elsewhere in this
// Digest reuses that exact citation here rather than re-deriving one; most
// of these terms are standard, settled medical/scientific vocabulary that
// this whole app's own already-verified research already rests on, not new
// claims of their own. `citations: []` is used deliberately for the small
// number of pure definitional/administrative terms with no single study
// behind the definition itself, matching the same precedent already set
// by this app's own opinion-synthesis entries. `relatedIds` on every entry
// points to the deeper entry elsewhere in this Digest where that term
// actually does its work; the glossary's own job is being a fast, accurate
// on-ramp into the rest of the app, not a dead end.
//
// Placed FIRST in this app's own category picker (DIGEST_CATEGORY_META,
// index.ts), a deliberate, explicit exception to this whole feature's own
// established "append, never reorder" practice for new categories, made
// because the request was specific and direct about position, not a
// default.
//
// 2026-08-08: content fields rewritten to remove AI-writing tics flagged
// directly by the person -- em dashes as punctuation, "not X, it's Y"
// contrast, and overused words like "real"/"genuinely"/"honest(ly)"/
// "worth" -- see bigPicture.ts's own header comment for the full context.
// Every fact, number, and citation is unchanged; the terse, dictionary-
// style format is preserved throughout, per this file's own design above.
//
// 2026-08-08, same day, a second pass: "go through the Basic Health area
// and move everything that is about autoimmune diseases and Hashimoto's
// references and hypothyroidism and all of the rest of the autoimmune
// disease references specifically... into the specific to those
// autoimmune disease's areas." 18 of the 57 terms here were genuinely,
// substantively ABOUT one specific disease or its own diagnostic/
// management vocabulary, not universal body-function knowledge a healthy
// person would need -- their `category` field was reassigned (16 to
// 'hashimotos': AIP, ALT/AST framed via hypothyroidism, APS-2, the
// autoimmune-disease definition itself, autophagy/mitophagy framed via
// Hashimoto's IL-23 research, 6-DFF, euthyroid/hypothyroid states,
// Healing Stages, IL-6/IL-23/TNF framed via Hashimoto's, levothyroxine,
// molecular mimicry, MOTS-c, Tg/anti-Tg, Th17, TPO, Wolff-Chaikoff; 1 to
// 'graves': the Graves' disease definition itself; 1 to
// 'fattyLiverDisease': NAFLD/MASLD, now its own real tracked condition).
// They stay physically in this file (one A-Z glossary remains the
// simplest way to author and browse the full term list), only their
// `category` changed -- the same "reassign the field, don't move the
// file" precedent this whole Digest's 2026-08-08 restructure already
// established for ProblemFoodEntry. A further 15 terms were genuinely
// universal, cross-cutting biology/immunology/methodology vocabulary
// (antibody & antigen, cytokine, eGFR, gliadin, insulin resistance, leaky
// gut, mitochondria, mTOR, ROS, Treg, visceral fat, zonulin, T4, tight
// junction, TSH) that happened to be worded or cited around a Hashimoto's
// example -- these were reworded to describe the general, healthy-body
// concept first and stay in Basic Health, with any Hashimoto's-specific
// citation either dropped (replaced with `citations: []`, matching this
// file's own existing precedent for pure definitional terms) or kept only
// where the citation itself was already general, not Hashimoto's-specific
// research. Every other term (24 of 57) needed no change at all --
// already genuinely condition-agnostic, matching what the user's own
// framing asked Basic Health to actually be: "everything the body does
// in a basic way... what foods do to help their body... what their body
// does with it," for someone without any of these 18 conditions, not
// disease-management vocabulary.
