// The 10th tab, added 2026-09-04, and its first real area, added
// 2026-09-05. Direct request: "Let's start with Finances... Finances is
// much larger than just tracking a few numbers. Match life against
// finances in a logical way, setup for the average person and the average
// things they would have for bills and charges."
//
// STRUCTURE, AND WHY IT IS ONE LENS RATHER THAN FOUR.
//
// Life is going to hold "a ton of things", so its lens list has to read as
// a list of AREAS, not as a flat pile of every view every area needs. Four
// lenses called Overview / Bills / Spending / Coming Up would make Life
// look like a money tab, and would leave nowhere obvious for the second
// area to go. So Finances is one lens with its own sections inside it,
// which is the pattern Digest already uses (a lens picks a category, then
// a menu picks a topic within it), rendered with the pill row this app
// uses for sub-navigation everywhere else.
//
// THE DESIGN, IN ONE LINE: a plan and a record are different things.
//
// finance_recurring is what is supposed to happen every month. Entries,
// grocery lines and therapy sessions are what actually did. Every other
// budgeting tool collapses those two and then cannot answer the only
// question that matters, which is whether they match. Overview shows them
// side by side and neither stands in for the other.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, DELIBERATELY:
//
// No bank connection. This app holds health data on one device with no
// backend, and handing a bank credential to anything would give that up on
// the least defensible possible grounds. Money is typed in, or it is read
// from what this app already collected.
//
// No invented savings figure for garden and ferment produce. The app knows
// which grocery lines were covered from the kitchen instead of bought,
// because those lines carry sourced_from_kitchen and deliberately carry no
// price. What that produce would have cost is genuinely unknown, and
// turning it into a dollar saving would be exactly the invented number
// this app refuses everywhere else. It is reported as a count of lines
// that did not have to be bought, which is a fact.

const TAB_COLOR = colors.tabLife;
// 1.0.61.7: this whole tab takes the calm look (CalmBands in
// components/HomeSectionBand.tsx): bands a left-accent width apart, no
// hairlines.
const band = makeTabBandStyles(TAB_COLOR, { calm: true });

// 'groceryList' is a lens in the menu only: picking it opens the grocery
// list screen (the same one Home's own Grocery List row opens) rather than
// a view inside this tab, so `lens` never actually holds it.
