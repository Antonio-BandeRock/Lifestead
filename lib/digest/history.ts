    title: '1912, Hakaru Hashimoto Described the Disease From Four Surgical Specimens',
    teaser: 'A disease now affecting millions was first noticed by one surgeon, looking closely at tissue from just four people.',
    summary: "Somewhere in a Japanese hospital in the early 1910s, a surgeon named Hakaru Hashimoto sat down with thyroid tissue removed from four separate patients during surgery, unremarkable, routine surgical specimens by any reasonable expectation. What he found in that tissue wasn't routine at all: diffuse infiltration of lymphoid cells forming lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, alongside fibrosis and tissue atrophy, a pattern nobody had described before. He published these findings in 1912, in a German surgical journal (German being the dominant language of medical publishing at the time), under the Latin name struma lymphomatosa. His work sat largely unrecognized for decades afterward.\n\nThe condition wasn't even renamed in his honor until much later, once the broader medical community finally recognized what he'd actually found: not a rare surgical curiosity, but the first clearly described case of a disease that would go on to affect millions of people worldwide. A reminder that everything else in the research traces back to one person, looking closely at four specimens, and refusing to assume what he was seeing was nothing.",

    summary: "In the early 1920s, a visible band of American states around the Great Lakes, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin among them, had earned a grim nickname: the \"goiter belt.\"\n\nPublic-health surveys found goiter, a visibly enlarged thyroid driven by iodine deficiency, in 70 to 100 percent of schoolchildren in parts of the region. Physician David Cowie, having studied European iodization practices already underway elsewhere, proposed a simple fix: add iodine to table salt. On May 1, 1924, Michigan salt manufacturers voluntarily began doing exactly that, with no law requiring it at all. A 1935 follow-up survey found enlarged-thyroid rates had dropped by as much as 90 percent in the years since. Direct historical proof that a simple, food-based intervention could measurably prevent a thyroid disease at population scale, and foundational to, but distinct from, the very different iodine-excess concerns Hashimoto's research raises today, a thread the research keeps returning to.",

    summary:
      "For decades, immunology held tightly to a concept with an almost dismissive-sounding Latin name: \"horror autotoxicus,\" the idea that a healthy immune system simply could not, and would not, attack the body's own tissue. In 1956, researchers Ivan Roitt and Deborah Doniach identified antibodies against thyroglobulin, a thyroid protein, circulating in the blood of Hashimoto's patients: direct, measurable evidence the immune system itself was attacking the thyroid.\n\nThis wasn't just a discovery about one disease. It was one of the first pieces of evidence that human autoimmune disease existed at all, opening the door to understanding dozens of other conditions, several of them covered elsewhere in this app's Other Autoimmune Diseases category, the same way. A turning point not just for Hashimoto's, but for how medicine as a whole came to understand the immune system's capacity to turn against its host.",

    teaser: 'Before this era, there was no reliable blood test that could tell anyone their thyroid status.',
    summary:
      "It's easy to take a routine thyroid blood test for granted. For most of medical history, no such test existed at all. The first TSH radioimmunoassay, a technique using radioactive tracers to measure a hormone's concentration, originated in 1965, and for roughly two decades that was the single most important tool available for diagnosing and managing hypothyroidism.\n\nBut this first generation could only reliably detect TSH at fairly high concentrations, missing the more subtle elevations seen in early or subclinical disease. The leap came with monoclonal antibody technology in the mid-1970s, enabling a \"sandwich\" assay design by the late 1980s that was dramatically more sensitive and specific, the direct ancestor of the ordinary TSH blood test used today. This is the actual reason a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with still-normal T4) is even possible to make at all. The diagnostic category itself couldn't exist until a test sensitive enough to detect it did.",

In 1985, researchers demonstrated that this \"microsomal antigen\" was in fact thyroid peroxidase, TPO, the very enzyme responsible for making thyroid hormone in the first place.\n\nThat meant the immune system was attacking the thyroid's hormone-production machinery directly, not some incidental bystander protein sitting nearby. This is the direct scientific origin of the modern TPO antibody blood test, the same lab value the Healing Stages research uses as its primary tracking signal, resting on a foundation laid nearly forty years earlier.",

    teaser: 'As recently as 1965, four out of five American thyroid prescriptions were still literally dried animal thyroid gland.',
    summary:
      "It's a strange thing to picture now, but for most of the 20th century, treating an underactive thyroid meant taking a pill made from an actual, dried animal gland. Thyroid organ therapy dates back to 1891, using desiccated (dried, ground) thyroid extract from pig or cow glands, and this remained the dominant treatment for over 70 years, with roughly 80 percent of US thyroid prescriptions still being natural desiccated thyroid as late as 1965.\n\nThe problem driving the eventual shift to synthetic levothyroxine: batch-to-batch potency in natural extract varied enormously, with some batches measured at anywhere from double to zero detectable hormone activity, a serious, documented dosing-consistency problem, not a theoretical one. Levothyroxine's synthetic, precisely-measurable dosing and simpler once-daily use made it the standard of care by the 1970s, and it remains the single most-prescribed medication in the US today. Natural desiccated thyroid is still prescribed for a minority of patients who report better symptom control on it despite normalized lab values, a thread still not fully settled even now.",

    summary: "Long before genome-wide studies were technically possible, researchers already suspected Hashimoto's ran in families, and linked it to specific immune-regulation genes, particularly CTLA-4, a gene that normally helps put the brakes on immune-cell activation. The first genome-wide association study (GWAS) dedicated specifically to Hashimoto's thyroiditis wasn't published until 2018, identifying new candidate genetic regions beyond what earlier candidate-gene studies alone had found. Even combining every genetic association discovered so far, known genetic variants explain only a modest share of who actually develops Hashimoto's.\n\nContinuing evidence that environmental and dietary factors, the core focus, matter alongside genetic susceptibility, not instead of it. Genetics may load the gun, in the old phrase, but they clearly aren't pulling the trigger alone.",

The same potency-variability problem that helped drive levothyroxine's rise actually had a partial fix: after 1985, natural desiccated thyroid manufacturing standardization measurably improved.\n\nBut by that point, levothyroxine's practical advantages (once-daily dosing, precise, easily-adjustable milligram-level dosing, and a growing base of clinical-trial evidence) had already made it the entrenched standard of care. As historical context, not a settled verdict either way: today's desiccated-thyroid products are more consistent than their pre-1985 predecessors, even though that improvement came after the field had already largely moved on.",

    summary: "\"My antibodies are positive but my TSH is still normal, how worried should I actually be?\" is a common question the antibody-tracking research keeps circling without ever giving a hard number. The answer traces back to one of epidemiology's landmark studies: the Whickham Survey, a cohort of 2,779 adults first surveyed in the 1970s and followed up 20 years later. The baseline rate of new spontaneous hypothyroidism in women overall was modest, roughly 3.5 to 4.1 cases per 1,000 women per year.\n\nThe striking finding sits in the risk-stratified numbers: women with both an elevated TSH and positive thyroid antibodies at the start had 38 times higher odds of developing overt hypothyroidism than women with neither, a quantified answer to exactly the anxious question above, not a vague \"it depends.\" That's a different situation from either risk factor alone (each independently carried about an 8-fold higher odds on its own). The combined risk is substantially more than either one by itself. A positive antibody result alongside even a mildly elevated TSH is meaningful information about future risk, which is exactly why the Self Advocacy category recommends periodic, not one-time, monitoring of both together.",

    teaser: 'The genome-wide search for specific genes is one kind of evidence. Comparing identical twins tells a striking part of the same story.',
    summary: "This category's genetic-era entry covers the search, still incomplete, for specific Hashimoto's susceptibility genes, CTLA-4 chief among them, plus a 2018 genome-wide study that found more candidate regions without fully explaining who actually develops the disease. A complementary kind of evidence comes from twin studies, which sidestep the \"which specific gene\" question entirely and instead ask a cleaner one: across a population of over 110,000 twins, how much of the difference in who gets an autoimmune disease and who doesn't comes down to genetics at all, versus environment? That same study found heritability running remarkably high across the family of organ-specific autoimmune diseases it examined, from 0.60 for Graves' disease up to a striking 0.97 for Addison's disease, with Hashimoto's included among the diseases studied, though the exact figure within that range couldn't be independently verified this session.\n\nBeyond CTLA-4, reviews also name HLA-DR variants and PTPN22 as additional, independently replicated susceptibility genes across autoimmune thyroid disease broadly, not just Hashimoto's specifically. A practical family-risk point: a parent, sibling, or child of someone with Hashimoto's carries a genetically elevated risk. Not a guarantee, and not yet reason to build a dedicated screening feature, but enough that a family member with unexplained fatigue or other Hashimoto's-adjacent symptoms has a legitimate, evidence-backed reason to ask their doctor for a thyroid panel rather than assume the connection is coincidental.",

The disease had to be described (1912) before it could be studied. Autoimmunity itself had to be proven (1956) before Hashimoto's could be understood as more than a medical mystery.\n\nA sensitive lab test had to be invented across two technological leaps (the 1960s radioimmunoassay, the 1970s-80s monoclonal-antibody sandwich assay) before \"subclinical\" disease could even be diagnosed at all. And the actual antigen had to be identified (1985) before a TPO antibody test, the same lab value the Healing Stages tracking leans on today, could exist in the first place. Even treatment itself took nearly a century to settle: 70-plus years of inconsistent desiccated animal thyroid before synthetic levothyroxine's precision finally won out in the 1970s.
