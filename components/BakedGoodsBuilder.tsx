// corner box already names whichever builder is open, so repeating it

// place, once Baked Good Name/Servings/Size is confirmed, that form splits into
// a compact two-column summary card (baked good info on the left, a scrollable
// ingredient list on the right) that then connects directly (flush, square
// corners at the seam) to FoodLookup's own Category/Food picker below it
// -- the picker shows automatically the instant there's no ingredient
// currently pending confirmation, rather than needing an explicit "+ Add
// Ingredient" tap first the way this used to work.

// Created 2026-08-02 by directly adapting SideBuilder.tsx (the Food tab's
// first fully-built builder and the proven, on-device-tested pattern every
// builder is meant to follow -- see CLAUDE.md's Food tab section), same
// base Fermentation/Beverage/Snack Builder used -- neither Salad's nor
// Smoothie's own raw-goitrogenic-load warning applies here. The comments
// below that carry earlier 2026-07-xx dates describe reasoning SideBuilder
// itself arrived at through real iteration -- inherited here as
// still-accurate design reasoning, not a claim that BakedGoodsBuilder went
// through that same history itself.
//
// Naming note: identifiers/types/tables that name the CATEGORY (this
// component, editBakedGoodsId, saveBakedGoods/getBakedGoods/updateBakedGoods,
// the baked_goods/baked_goods_ingredients tables) use the plural
// "BakedGoods," matching the lens key ('bakedGoodsBuilder') and this
// builder's own place in FOOD_LENSES. Fields/prose about ONE saved record
// (bakedGoodName, the "Baked Good Name" label, the finished-name fallback)
// use the singular "baked good" instead, the same way a real person would
// say "I saved a baked good," not "I saved a baked goods."
//
// No new fields needed, unlike Fermentation ('Fermented' added to
// COOKING_METHODS) or Beverage (EXTRAS_TO_CHECK emptied out) -- 'Baked' was
// already a real option in the inherited COOKING_METHODS list, and the "no
// cooking oil/fat or seasoning" nudge is kept unchanged (same reasoning as
// Snack): butter/oil and cinnamon/salt are both genuinely common in baked
// goods, unlike a beverage.

  //
  // Together the box settles at max(label width, widest pill width) with no

  // Servings/Size/Units all use this -- see the JSX comment above them for

  // sizeLabelRow / scrollHint / sizeInputGroup / amountPicker lived here

  // Units pickers side by side under a shared label row. That whole shape
  // was replaced by four stacked, individually-labeled fields
  // (renderLabeledPicker), leaving these with no callers, so they were
  // removed rather than left as dead styles.

  // The unit/amount pills sit inline beside their own sibling (unit next
  // to the amount picker, or Servings alone in its own row), 2026-07-28,
  // as a scrollable box (vertical since 2026-07-29, see renderPillPicker's
  // own comment) so every option stays reachable without needing to grow
  // wider. Bordered -- a plain unbounded
  // ScrollView butted right up against its sibling had nothing marking
  // where one ends and the other begins. Same colors.border/borderRadius
  // recipe as formInput's own outline (below), so this reads as matching
  // form chrome. Background is applied inline at the render site instead
  // of here, matching every input's own backgroundColor -- both need the
  // live tabColor prop to compute (inputBackground(tabColor)), which a
  // static StyleSheet object has no access to.
  //
  // Deliberately has no width/flex of its own -- renderPillPicker always
  // pairs this with EITHER a fixed-width style (servingsPicker/
  // amountPicker) OR pillScrollFlex below, never both at once (flex: 1
  // implies flexBasis: 0%, which would silently win over an explicit
  // width set alongside it, undoing the fixed width entirely).
  // The ScrollView inside spans this box's FULL size, 2026-07-28 (see
  // renderPillPicker's own "fourth pass" comment for why) -- the two
  // scrollArrowBadge indicators are an absolute overlay on top of it, not
  // separate flex siblings, so a drag starting anywhere in this box,
  // including visually on top of a badge, still reaches the ScrollView
  // underneath and scrolls it. overflow: 'hidden' keeps the ScrollView's
  // own content clipped to this box's rounded corners, same reasoning as
  // InlineSelectList.tsx's own container.
  //
  // height added 2026-07-29 (the fifth-pass switch to vertical scrolling,
  // see renderPillPicker's own comment) -- a ScrollView needs a bounded
  // cross-axis size to actually scroll rather than just growing to fit
  // its content; the old horizontal version got this for free from the
  // row's own width, but a vertical one needs it stated explicitly.
  // Picked to comfortably show about two pills at rest with a clear peek
  // of a third -- enough to read as "a short scrollable list," not so
  // tall it dominates the Servings/Size/Units row it sits in. Tune
  // on-device if it reads too cramped or too tall in practice.
  // The unit picker's own sizing -- fills exactly whatever width its row
  // has left after its sibling's own fixed width (Servings, or the amount
  // picker beside it); height now comes from pillScroll's own fixed
  // height above regardless of how much content there is to scroll.
  // paddingVertical widened 2026-07-29 (was paddingHorizontal, back when
  // this scrolled sideways -- see renderPillPicker's own "fifth pass"
  // comment) so a real pill never scrolls in directly underneath either
  // scrollArrowBadge (a 16px badge inset 2px from the top/bottom edge
  // reaches ~18px in) -- the same reasoning as before, just rotated 90
  // degrees along with the scroll axis. paddingHorizontal shrunk back
  // down since there's no longer a left/right badge to clear.
  // pillRow / pill lived here until 2026-07-31 -- the wrapping chip grid
  // the Cooking Method step used before it became the "Cook Prep"
  // vertical spinner. Every pill in this component now goes through
  // renderPillPicker, so both are gone rather than left unreferenced.

  // The only pill style left, used inside every scrollable pill picker
  // (renderPillPicker). Its shorter paddingVertical (4, vs the 6 the old
  // wrapping `pill` used) came from the 2026-07-28 box-shrinking pass.
  // textAlign matters now that renderLabeledPicker stretches every pill to
  // the widest one's width -- without it, short options ("1/8", "Diced")
  // would sit left-aligned in a wide pill instead of centered in it.
  // Extra room above the Baked Good Name form's own Continue button, 2026-07-28

  // line, and on a narrower one they wrap to two-by-two automatically. No
  // breakpoint, no device check, no second layout to maintain -- the row
  // simply uses whatever width the phone gives it.
  //
  // Measured before committing to this, back when these four fields were
  // combination-lock wheels (2026-07-31): with "Whole" and "Raw" trimmed
  // (see CUT_PREP_METHODS/COOKING_METHODS), four across needed ~361px
  // against ~414px before the trim, moving it from "only the largest
  // phones" to "most phones," with graceful wrapping for the rest. Those
  // exact numbers are stale now that the fields are PopoverSelect's own
  // shorter chevron-style boxes (2026-08-01, narrower than a wheel's own
  // fixed frame), but the reasoning -- keep the row's own real width
  // trimmed rather than device-checking a breakpoint -- still holds.
  // space-between lived here 2026-07-31 to 2026-08-01 -- explicitly
  // reverted the same day the fields themselves gained hand-
  // aware reordering (see useReorderedLabeledFields, this file's own
  // top). Spreading fields evenly across the row fought that reordering
  // visually: a field that just slid to the "away" end still needs to
  // read as having moved TOWARD that edge, not as one more evenly-spaced
  // item in an unchanged layout. flex-start packs every field against its
  // neighbours instead, so a reordering field visibly travels somewhere,
  // with columnGap as the only spacing between them. Still composes with
  // flexWrap the same way: each wrapped line packs its own contents
  // independently, and the two-by-two fallback on a narrow screen still
  // reads as one deliberate cluster rather than spread thin.
