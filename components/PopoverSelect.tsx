// Replaces components/WheelPicker.tsx entirely, 2026-08-01, the same day
// that combination-lock wheel picker was built -- not a restyle of it, a
// different interaction altogether. The wheel's own drag-to-scroll
// mechanic turned out to have two real, reported usability problems no
// amount of tuning fixed: it always needed a first touch just to "wake up"
// before it could actually be dragged (see WheelPicker's own git history
// for the lazy-activation attempt that surfaced this), and a dragging
// finger physically covers the one row -- the live, centre one -- a
// person is trying to watch settle. Both are inherent to a small,
// finger-dragged dial; neither is fixable by patching that mechanic
// further. This is a plain field that opens a small list of tappable
// options instead: no drag gesture at all, so nothing to wake up first and
// nothing for a finger to cover mid-selection -- the single most common
// pattern high-quality apps use for "choose one from a short list," and
// the same one this app's own Dropdown.tsx already proves out elsewhere
// (Category/Food/etc. pickers), just anchored to the side of the field
// instead of below it (see computePopoverPosition below) and restyled to
// the app's current dark palette rather than Dropdown's own stale,
// pre-redesign colours.
//
// 2026-08-08: gained an optional `searchable` mode, reusing Dropdown.tsx's
// own proven AppKeyboard search-row mechanism (setSearchRequest) rather
// than inventing a second one -- explicitly requested as the standing
// pattern for every picker in the app going forward, not just a one-off:
// "all dropdown menus need to be selectable scroll lists just like those
// on the Side Dish Builder Dish Name page... the app keyboard can pop up
// to search as the list could definitely be longer." This is now the one
// real distinction left between this component and Dropdown.tsx -- both
// share the same search mechanism and dark-palette styling; this one
// anchors beside its field with a fixed-height list (short-list-friendly),
// Dropdown always opens below with a variable height (better for a field
// that needs to sit flush against a long scrolling form). Also gained
// `options` accepting real label/value pairs (DropdownOption), not just a
// plain word standing in for its own value -- needed the moment a picker's
// display text (a medication's generic name, a nutrient's display name)
// differs from what's actually stored (a database id/code). Plain
// `string[]` still works unchanged for every existing short-list caller.

              during an active freeze) found the app's own native main UI
              thread -- not the JS thread, not Android's input dispatcher --
              sustaining 60-90% CPU for the whole ~15s gap, real, ongoing
              native work, not an idle/stuck thread. That redirects this
              investigation squarely at native view mount/unmount cost, and
              FlatList is real, load-bearing overhead this component never
              actually needed: every real option list here is small (39
              nutrients at most, MAX_VISIBLE_ROWS/_SEARCHABLE already cap
              what's visible to 6-8 at once) -- FlatList's own virtualization
              machinery (windowing, cell recycling, its own internal mount/
              unmount bookkeeping on every open/close) was pure cost for a
              dataset this size, never real benefit. Replaced with a plain
              ScrollView over a directly-mapped list -- the same real,
              proven pattern this app's own InlineSelectList/Dropdown menus
              already use successfully for comparable option counts. This
              also makes every real FlatList-specific bug this component has
              already fixed (see the two real, dated FlatList-quirk
              writeups kept just below as real history, not because they
              still describe the current code) structurally unreachable
              rather than individually patched around -- there's no
              initialScrollIndex/getItemLayout/removeClippedSubviews
              mechanism left to have a quirk in at all.

              2026-08-11, real history kept for context, even though the
              FlatList it describes is gone: React Native's FlatList, given
              initialScrollIndex, used to start its own first render batch
              counting FROM that index, not the top of the array -- items
              above it never rendered at all unless a real scroll gesture
              passed them, which a short, already-fits-its-box list can't
              trigger. Two real attempts (forcing the whole list to render
              via initialNumToRender, then scoping that to just
              selectedIndex + 1) each fixed part of it but reintroduced a
              real ~15s stall of their own on Nutrient Ranking's own longer
              39-item list. The actual fix at the time was dropping
              initialScrollIndex entirely and positioning the list AFTER a
              cheap, ordinary initial render via a directly-computed pixel
              offset instead -- the same real approach (offset math, not
              index-based scrolling) this ScrollView-based version below
              still uses, now scrollTo instead of FlatList's own
              scrollToOffset. removeClippedSubviews=false was a separate,
              real, well-precedented Android-specific hypothesis tried the
              same day (re-tested on-device, the exact same delay still
              reproduced, ruling it out) -- moot now too, alongside every
              other FlatList-specific prop this file used to carry. */}

  // and OverlayRoot (a separate component, mounted at the app's true root)
  // actually re-rendering to reflect it -- happening even though this
  // component's own isOpen state had already committed fast. A plain
  // useEffect callback is scheduled as regular-priority work, deferrable
  // by React's own scheduler; useLayoutEffect runs synchronously as part
  // of the same commit instead, giving this specific update no room to be
  // deprioritized behind whatever else the scheduler is weighing at that
  // moment. A real, low-risk, surgical change -- only affects when this
  // one effect runs relative to paint, not what it does.

  // directly-computed offset -- see the ScrollView-replaced-FlatList
  // comment above for why this stays offset-based math rather than an
  // index-based scroll call. Also runs with no dependency array (matching
  // this file's own convention above), guarded by hasScrolledToSelectionRef
  // so it only ever actually scrolls once per real open, not on every
  // render.

  // Feeds this picker's own search text into AppKeyboard's search row

  //
  // 2026-08-12: real, reported bug -- opening Nutrient Ranking's own
  // searchable field (39 real tracked nutrients) froze the whole app for
  // ~15 real seconds before the popover and the keyboard both suddenly
  // appeared together, with any other pending tap (a TabHub press made
  // mid-freeze) flushing at the same moment -- the signature of the JS
  // thread being genuinely busy, not just one row being slow to render.
  // Root cause: this effect had no dependency array and called
  // setSearchRequest with a BRAND NEW object on literally every render of
  // this component, unconditionally, even when nothing about the search
  // state had actually changed. That's normally harmless for a stable
  // caller, but Nutrient Ranking's own `options` prop was rebuilt fresh on
  // every render of ITS parent (see NutrientRankingView's own fix in
  // insights.tsx) -- defeating this component's memo() bailout, so ANY
  // unrelated re-render of that screen re-rendered this component too,
  // which re-fired this effect, which called setSearchRequest again,
  // which re-rendered AppKeyboard (the one real consumer of searchRequest,
  // mounted at the app root) again -- a real, high-frequency cascade, not
  // a literal infinite loop (it does eventually settle), but easily heavy
  // enough to read as a genuine freeze. The exact same shape as two prior,
  // already-fixed infinite-render bugs in this app (see
  // ActiveInputContext.tsx's own two "no dependency array" warnings) --
  // this is a real, live third instance of the same class of problem.
  //
  // Fixed at both ends: the caller-side fix (memoizing `options`) should
  // already stop this component from re-rendering needlessly. This is the
  // belt-and-suspenders half, directly on the piece that actually raises
  // the keyboard -- a real content guard (a ref tracking what was last
  // actually dispatched) means setSearchRequest only fires when the
  // meaningful values (open/closed, the typed text, the placeholder)
  // genuinely changed, not on every incidental re-render, regardless of
  // whether some future caller elsewhere in the app ever reintroduces an
  // unmemoized options prop the same way. Still fully live the moment
  // something real does change (typing, opening, closing) -- nothing here
  // delays or debounces an actual update, it only skips redundant ones.
