// 2026-07-28: fills the gap deliberately left between the LensHub button
// and the butterfly -- a "My Foods"/"My Insights"/"My Schedules"/etc.
// shortcut into whatever's been saved/favorited for that page, the one
// action shaped the same way across every Lens (unlike the Lens picker
// itself, which is different content on every page). Same icon everywhere
// (bookmarks-outline, plural -- a personal library, not a single "save
// this one thing" bookmark), only the label (used for the popup's own
// header and accessibility only, see below) and this page's own tabColor
// vary.
//
// Deliberately smaller and unlabeled, 2026-07-28 -- explicitly asked not
// to read as prominently as the real corner icons (LensHub/TabHub): no
// visible text under it, and its own icon is sized at 2/3 of LensHub's
// corner icon (32px there -> 21px here), so it reads as a quieter, lesser
// shortcut rather than a third full-weight navigation button competing
// with the two real ones.
//
// Positioned at the midpoint of the real gap between LensHub's own button
// and the butterfly, not a fixed slot -- computed live from both of their
// actual positions (useBottomLeftHubPosition/windowWidth) rather than a
// guessed pixel offset, so it stays centered in that gap even if either
// button's own position ever changes.
//
// Genuinely generic still -- this component knows nothing about sides,
// favorites, salads, or any other specific kind of saved item, and never
// should: every Food builder is expected to eventually produce its own
// kind of saved/favorited thing, each wanting its own Insights lens later
// (see app/food-items.tsx's own comment for the fuller picture). This
// popup's own job stays fixed regardless of how many builders exist --
// show whatever CATEGORIES the caller currently has real data for, as
// plain tappable links, and get out of the way. A caller with real
// categories to show (Food tab, as of 2026-08-01, is the first, with
// "Saved Sides"/"Favorite Sides") passes them via `categories`; a caller
// with nothing yet (Insights/Schedule/etc., still) passes nothing and
// gets the original placeholder text, matching this app's established
// "coming soon" honesty rather than claiming a working feature that isn't
// there yet on THAT page.
//
// 2026-08-01: this used to show each category's items inline, expanded,
// with no way to tap into any of them -- replaced with plain links out to
// a real list screen (see onPress) after being reported as "nothing is
// selectable." A category with a real onPress handler is what actually
// lets a person get somewhere; showing five saved sides' names inline in
// a cramped popup never did.
