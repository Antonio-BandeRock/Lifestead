// What the computer version cannot do, and the sentence that says so.
//
// Direct instruction, 2026-09-21, the first day the desktop build ran:
// "the Windows version needs to let the user know when anything their
// computer can't do is selected. They can't use the windows version to
// scan products, they have to use their mobile app for that."
//
// The desktop build (desktop/, the same code in an Electron window) has no
// camera the app can use, no speech recognizer on a Mac (Windows has one
// since 1.0.66.24), no Health
// Connect, no mDNS and no LAN server, and it cannot yet keep or show a
// picked photo. metro.config.js swaps each of those packages for
// lib/desktop/unavailableModule.ts, which loads and does nothing, so a
// screen that reaches one used to look broken rather than saying anything:
// the scanner lens asked for camera access that never came, the Movement
// lens said "this phone cannot share health data", and the microphone
// button reported that speech recognition was not available "right now".
//
// This is the one list of those things, one entry per feature, each with
// the sentence that names what the phone does instead. Everything that
// says it goes through here (components/PhoneOnlyNotice.tsx for a lens or
// screen that is phone-only as a whole, announcePhoneOnly below for a
// button), so a feature that reaches the desktop later is removed from this
// list once and every notice for it goes with it. No React and no bridge
// call in here, so scripts/test_phone_only.js covers the wording.
