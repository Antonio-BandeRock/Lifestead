// "Find a meal you've had" -- 2026-08-30, replacing the Log Again tile strip
// that shipped a few hours earlier the same day.
//
// Direct steer, and it was right: "random meals being presented to possibly
// have them again doesn't make sense. It could be a shortcut to reschedule a
// past meal and they then see a standard scrollable list of meal names to
// choose from, with a search field to filter by a specific word rather than
// remembering what it was named in the app."
//
// The premise behind the tiles (most logging is a repeat of something already
// logged) still holds. The presentation did not. Eight guessed tiles assume the
// app knows someone is eating right now, and the moment the meal they want is
// not among those eight there is no way to reach it at all. A searchable list
// serves the moments that actually happen: something was eaten instead of what
// was planned, logging is being caught up after the fact, or a known meal is
// being put on the calendar.
//
// relogMeal and the rest of the machinery underneath are unchanged; only the
// way in is different.
//
// Renamed the same day, on a second steer: "Find a Meal You've Had is
// mislabeled because they could want to find a meal they haven't had yet. It
// should also have access to the system meals generally in an order that makes
// sense." So this is not a history list, it is the whole catalogue of meals
// reachable without opening a builder.
//
// Corrected again straight after, and the correction was right on both counts.
// The first pass renamed the screen title and the Food menu entry but left the
// Home button reading "Find a meal you have had", which is the one people
// actually tap. And the same release hid auto-generated carrier favorites,
// which was correct in itself but took away the only way meals from a 6-week
// plan could be found here, so the screen filled up with system recipes and
// looked like it had swapped one thing for the other.
//
// Both fixed. Meals already scheduled but not yet eaten now have their own
// section, which is the most literal reading of "a meal they haven't had yet",
// and a Yours/System filter keeps 300-plus curated recipes from burying a
// handful of the person's own meals.
