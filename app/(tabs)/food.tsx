// this project has no git repository at all, so that manual backup is the
// only safety net for reviving any of that logic (ingredient search,
// favorites, rotation, etc.) when rebuilding each builder for real.
//
// Known loose end from this deletion: Schedule's "Log now" action and
// Home's Day Arc both navigate to '/' with scheduleItemId/mealType/title/
// favoriteId/templateMealId params, expecting the old builder to read them
// (via useLocalSearchParams) and open pre-filled. Nothing here reads those

// because it isn't a food category the way the other ten are -- it's the
// assembly action that combines THEIR saved output ("Meal Builder" names
// doing the assembly; "Meals Builder" would read like a generic app name).
// Fermentation stays singular because unlike Sauces/Snacks/Soups/Sides/
// Beverages it has no natural plural food-category form -- "Fermentations"
// reads clinical, like separate lab batches, not a recognizable menu-style
// label. Internal identifiers (lens keys below, component file names,
// database tables, per-item function names, itemType values) deliberately
// stay singular throughout -- matching the precedent Sauces Builder
// already set (display name "Sauces," but getSauce/sauces
// table/'sauce' itemType all stay singular) -- only what's actually shown
// on screen changed.
