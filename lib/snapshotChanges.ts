// What changed since this device was last in step, in words a person reads.
//
// 2026-09-22, direct report: "the message on the mobile or the windows
// version lets me know it is warning that it will be using the version
// from the other device because it has changed something this version
// needs to pick up, but it doesn't actually say what the change was that
// caused this update to synchronize from the other device. It should say
// what the change was that happened so the user can be reminded of it."
//
// HOW IT WORKS. Every snapshot save stamps each table with its row count
// and a hash of its contents (stampTables), compares that against the
// stamp kept from the last save or load (describeChanges), and writes the
// resulting phrases into the snapshot itself, inside the encryption. The
// device that loads the copy reads them back and says them. The plain
// record in the shared folder is deliberately left alone: it carries no
// health content so a device can see that something arrived without a
// password, and "2 more lab results" would break that.
//
// A COUNT COMES FROM ONE TABLE PER AREA. A salad and its six ingredient
// rows are one salad, so each area names the table whose rows are the
// things a person would count, and lists its supporting tables as quiet:
// they mark the area as changed without adding to the number. Areas where
// a count means nothing at all (a profile, the settings) count nothing and
// only ever report edits.
//
// A TABLE THE STAMP HAS NEVER SEEN IS PASSED OVER, once. A version that
// adds a table arrives with rows in it already, and calling those an
// addition would be wrong; they are counted from the next stamp onward.
//
// This module does no I/O and imports nothing, so
// scripts/test_snapshot_changes.js can check every phrase without a phone.
// lib/snapshotSync.ts builds the sentences around these phrases and
// lib/snapshotSyncDevice.ts does the reading and writing.
