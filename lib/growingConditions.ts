// Growing conditions as a record (2026-09-23, stage 0 of the sensor work).
//
// The reading is separated from the radio. A soil moisture figure is worth
// the same whether it arrived over Wi-Fi from a sensor somebody soldered or
// was read off a twelve-dollar meter pushed into the bed, and until this
// module there was nowhere in the app to put one at all: eleven garden
// tables held what was planted, spent, picked and eaten, and not one held a
// measurement of the conditions any of it grew in. Every later way of
// filling this record, discovered sensors on the local network, a camera, a
// commercial account, is an optional way of writing the same rows.
//
// Everything here is pure, so scripts/test_growing_conditions.js checks the
// arithmetic and every sentence without a phone.
//
// Four of the rules the cross-app push settled bind this file:
//   - A month with nothing measured is a GAP, never a zero. Every periodic
//     figure is `number | null` and a blank month says so in words.
//   - Units are never converted across kinds. Celsius and Fahrenheit are one
//     family and convert; a percentage and a centibar are two different
//     physical quantities and stay on separate lines, as do lux and PPFD.
//   - A figure is never guessed at. Nothing here interpolates a missing day
//     or carries a reading forward.
//   - Plain date columns need no local-day handling. `measured_on` is a
//     plain date, so nothing here goes through a Date for a day.
