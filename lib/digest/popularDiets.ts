    title: 'The One Trial That Pits 14 Named Diets Against Each Other Directly',
    teaser: 'Nearly every study behind these diets tests one diet against no diet at all. A 2020 network meta-analysis of 121 trials and 21,942 people did something rarer: it compared the diets against each other.',
    summary:
      "Almost every diet entry cites a trial testing one diet against a non-dieting control group, evidence for that one diet, but not a direct answer to \"which of these works better than the others.\" One exception exists: a 2020 network meta-analysis pooled 121 randomized trials covering 21,942 participants across 14 popular named diet programmes, sorted into three macronutrient groups: low-carbohydrate (Atkins, South Beach, Zone), moderate-macronutrient (Biggest Loser, DASH, Jenny Craig, Mediterranean, Portfolio, Slimming World, Volumetrics, Weight Watchers), and low-fat (Ornish, Rosemary Conley). At 6 months, low-carbohydrate and low-fat patterns produced a similar, modest weight loss, roughly 4 to 5kg more than no diet at all, with moderate-macronutrient patterns trailing slightly behind both. Among the individually named diets, Atkins, DASH, and Zone showed the largest effect, roughly 3.5 to 5.5kg. No diet significantly improved HDL cholesterol or C-reactive protein at 6 months. The Mediterranean diet stood out as the one pattern that kept a measurable LDL cholesterol improvement past the 6-month mark; every other pattern's cardiovascular gains, and most of its weight loss, had faded substantially by 12 months. The authors' stated conclusion, directly quoted rather than paraphrased into something stronger: differences between individual named diets were \"generally trivial to small,\" and someone can reasonably choose whichever one they can sustain without much concern over which specific named diet wins on paper. A correction to this paper was later published in BMJ (2020;370:m3095); its exact content could not be confirmed after multiple searches, named directly here rather than treated as settled, though nothing found in the process contradicted the topline structure reported above.",

    title: 'Every Diet Here Compared on What It Is Built From, Its Evidence, and What It Leaves Out',
    teaser: "Pulling every diet here into one direct comparison: what each is built from, what evidence backs it, and what it risks leaving out.",
    summary:
      "Composition first, since it's the most concrete, checkable difference. Only a handful of these are defined by a fixed macronutrient ratio rather than by which foods are included or excluded. The ketogenic diet has no single standard number, StatPearls names three distinct clinical variants: a traditional version (roughly 55-60% fat, 30-35% protein, 5-10% carbohydrate), a modified Atkins approach (60-70% fat, 25-30% protein, under 20g carbohydrate daily), and a very-low-carbohydrate version (20-50g carbohydrate daily, 60-75% fat), all converging on the same underlying trigger for ketosis: carbohydrate intake kept below roughly 20-50g a day, not one fixed ratio. Paleo's published range is wider than its popular reputation suggests, a cross-cultural analysis of Paleolithic-era diets found 19-35% protein, 22-40% carbohydrate, and 28-58% fat, a spread wide enough that \"Paleo\" describes a food list (no grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar) more than a fixed macronutrient target. High-protein eating is typically framed against the RDA of 0.8g of protein per kg of body weight per day, a floor set to prevent deficiency, not to optimize muscle retention, expert consensus for muscle-preservation goals runs closer to 1.2g/kg/day and higher for anyone exercising regularly. AIP inherits Paleo's composition, then narrows the food list further (also removing eggs, nuts, seeds, and nightshades). Vegan, vegetarian, plant-based/flexitarian, omnivore, carnivore, and Mediterranean eating are each defined by which foods are included or excluded, not by hitting a specific percentage of calories from any macronutrient.\n\nEvidence strength, reusing each diet's already-assigned tier rather than a fresh judgment call: Mediterranean, plant-based/flexitarian, dairy-free, high-protein, fibermaxxing, gut-friendly eating, and cutting ultra-processed food are all already tiered strong, each backed by a randomized trial or a large systematic review, not a single small or uncontrolled study. Keto, vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, gluten-free avoidance without celiac disease, Paleo, and AIP are tiered moderate, credible evidence exists for each, with a complication named directly in that diet's entry (keto's emerging LDL question in lean adults, veganism's B12 deficiency risk, AIP's protocol carrying thinner direct trial support than several of the individual pieces it's built from). Carnivore is the one entry in this whole category tiered weak, because a direct literature search found almost no dedicated human research on it at all rather than because it has been tested and found wanting, an absence that means neither safety nor danger.\n\nDocumented risk if followed without planning, the most actionable comparison for anyone choosing between these: a direct comparative study found vitamin B12 deficiency in 44.1% of vegans against 15.0% of lacto-ovo vegetarians in the same population, a nearly threefold gap that closes considerably once dairy and eggs stay in the diet. Paleo and AIP both eliminate dairy entirely, the same calcium, vitamin D, and B12 source dedicated dairy-free eating already has to plan around; a strictly gluten-free diet without a diagnosed reason carries a documented cost too, commercial gluten-free products running lower in protein and fiber and higher in sugar and price than their gluten-containing equivalents, with no measured benefit for anyone without celiac disease or a diagnosed sensitivity to offset it. Carnivore's zero-plant-food structure directly forfeits dietary fiber entirely, the one nutrient this app's gut-microbiome research names as the single most food-controllable lever for training immune tolerance. High-protein eating carries one clear, well-documented exception rather than a general risk: anyone with already-reduced kidney function, where a lower, not higher, protein target shows a documented benefit instead.\n\nWhat holds across nearly every one of these entries, not just the strongly-tiered ones: the diets built around whole, minimally processed food, Mediterranean, plant-based/flexitarian, and whole-food versions of vegetarian, vegan, Paleo, and omnivorous eating alike, keep showing up with credible evidence behind them, while the specific label attached matters less than the direct network meta-analysis above already found. The diets that differ most sharply from each other aren't necessarily the ones with the most opposite-sounding names, they're the ones built around fundamentally different structures: a fixed macronutrient ratio (keto), a defined elimination-then-reintroduction protocol (AIP), a food list built from an assumed ancestral diet (Paleo), or simply which foods are included or excluded (nearly everything else).",

    summary: "Of all these eating styles, the Mediterranean diet carries the deepest, most consistent evidence, and the research across multiple conditions (cardiovascular disease, RA, psoriasis, fatty liver disease) keeps landing on the same pattern independently. It traces back to the Seven Countries Study, the first major research effort to directly compare cardiovascular disease rates across different countries and diets, which found Mediterranean, olive-oil-and-produce-heavy populations carrying roughly half the cardiovascular disease rate of northern European populations eating more saturated fat. That observational finding has since been confirmed in randomized controlled trials: the landmark PREDIMED trial found a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts measurably reducing cardiovascular events in a randomized, controlled setting. The research finds the same pattern repeating across RA (a randomized trial finding a 76% drop in disease-activity score), psoriasis (a randomized 2025 trial reducing severity), and fatty liver disease (performing as well as a low-fat diet in head-to-head testing). No single food defines it. Whole-food eating built around olive oil, vegetables, legumes, fish, and whole grains, low in processed food and added sugar, is the consistent thread across every one of these trials.",

    summary:
      "The ketogenic diet, a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat eating pattern designed to shift the body into fat-burning ketosis, has established medical roots: it has been used clinically for intractable epilepsy, including in children, for decades-long, well-documented benefit, not a recent wellness trend. For weight loss specifically, research finds it works, largely through the same mechanism as any other approach that reduces total calorie intake, not a unique metabolic advantage keto alone provides. A 2026 review names an emerging clinical concern directly in its title, ketogenic diets can produce large increases in LDL cholesterol specifically in adults with a normal body weight, a documented pattern (sometimes called the 'lean mass hyper-responder' phenomenon) raising questions about long-term cardiovascular risk that the field itself is still actively working through, not a settled question either way. Additional complications: the diet is hard to sustain long-term, an initial 'keto flu' adjustment period is commonly reported, and its very low carbohydrate intake can make it difficult to reach the fiber intake most people already fall short of without careful planning.",

    summary: "Intermittent fasting (IF), timed eating windows like the popular 16:8 method rather than a specific list of foods, has direct randomized trial support behind it. A controlled trial comparing alternate-day fasting, 16:8 time-restricted eating, and a non-fasting control group over 3 weeks (with a 3-month follow-up) found both fasting approaches producing significantly more weight and BMI reduction than the control group, with alternate-day fasting outperforming the milder 16:8 pattern specifically. The leading explanation across the broader body of research is that IF works largely because it makes eating less overall easier for many people, the same mechanism behind any calorie-reduction approach, not a distinct metabolic advantage unique to the timing itself. Complications: IF isn't equally suitable for everyone, the Type 1 diabetes research names complexity in timing insulin around a fasting window, and the research on fasting and thyroid hormone finds measurable effects on TSH and thyroid lab values during sustained fasting (the IFTAR/Ramadan research). IF is a legitimate tool for many people specifically because it makes sticking with reduced calorie intake easier, not because it changes metabolism in some deeper way most other approaches don't.",

What existing nutrition science DOES say, applied to a diet with zero plant food by definition: it necessarily eliminates dietary fiber entirely, directly contradicting the extensively-documented, mechanistic research on short-chain fatty acids, gut bacteria, and immune tolerance (the single most food-controllable lever the gut-microbiome research has found). It also runs directly against well-established findings on red and processed meat, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies processed meat as a confirmed human carcinogen and red meat as a probable one, tied to colorectal cancer risk specifically. The almost complete absence of dedicated carnivore-diet research means any specific claim of benefit or harm beyond these already-established, general nutrition-science facts is unverified, not proven safe, and not proven dangerous by direct study, simply untested.",

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases reports roughly 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance by age 20, with prevalence varying widely by ethnicity, notably higher among people of Asian, African, or Native American heritage. The same federal source names the practical concern directly: lactose intolerance can affect health specifically by crowding out calcium and vitamin D, both covered in this app's Essential Nutrients research, once dairy gets cut without deliberately replacing what it was providing. The practical takeaway: dairy-free eating is a reasonable, often medically necessary response to a well-documented digestive condition rather than a wellness trend to second-guess, and calcium, vitamin D, and B12, all three concentrated in dairy, are worth actively planning for through fortified alternatives or other food sources rather than assumed to take care of themselves.",

    summary:
      "The Paleolithic diet, built around lean meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, and nuts while excluding grains, legumes, dairy, and added sugar or salt, has direct randomized-trial evidence behind it. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials found the diet produced measurable reductions in body weight, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, alongside improved cholesterol markers and reduced inflammation as measured by C-reactive protein, compared against other diets used as controls. The same research names the complication: the study's sensitivity analysis found the effects on lipid profile, blood pressure, and C-reactive protein specifically didn't fully hold up once individual trials were removed one at a time, a signal the overall picture is measurably positive but not yet as settled as the headline numbers alone suggest. A structural point worth planning around regardless of that debate: Paleo eliminates dairy and legumes entirely, the same two food groups the dairy-free and vegetarian entries already name as significant calcium, fiber, and protein sources, worth replacing deliberately rather than assumed unnecessary.",

    teaser: 'Research keeps finding the same benefit shows up gradually as meat intake drops, without needing to eliminate it entirely, good news for anyone put off by strict veganism\'s documented deficiency risks.',
    summary: "Plant-based, flexitarian eating (deliberately reducing, not eliminating, meat and animal products in favor of more whole plant foods) sits between the vegan research and its Mediterranean research, and shares evidence with both. Cardiovascular and metabolic benefit tracks with the degree of plant-food emphasis in a diet, not an all-or-nothing threshold, meaning a flexible, mostly-plant pattern captures meaningful benefit without necessarily carrying the vegan-specific B12 deficiency risk, since flexitarian eating typically still includes at least some animal-product intake. The Mediterranean research is itself a practical example of exactly this kind of flexible, plant-forward-but-not-strict pattern, built around whole plant foods, healthy fats, and fish, with only moderate meat intake, not full elimination. This flexible middle ground is an evidence-backed, and often more sustainable long-term option for many people than either strict veganism or unrestricted eating, precisely because it doesn't require the same careful nutrient-gap planning a fully vegan diet does, while still capturing much of the same documented benefit.",

    teaser: 'Protein\'s well-documented satiety and muscle-preserving role holds up well for most healthy people. The one exception: anyone with existing kidney disease, where the research says otherwise.',
    summary: "Prioritizing higher protein intake, sometimes called 'proteinmaxxing' in current usage, especially to protect muscle mass while eating less or as part of aging, rests on already-established nutrition science the Essential Nutrients research covers directly: protein carries a well-documented satiety effect (helping someone feel fuller on fewer total calories) and a direct role in preserving lean muscle mass, particularly relevant during weight loss or as part of normal aging, when muscle loss becomes a documented health risk in its own right. For people with already-healthy kidneys, current nutrition science doesn't find higher protein intake within normal higher-end ranges causing kidney harm. The one important exception: the chronic kidney disease research finds different guidance applies once kidney function is already reduced, where a specific, lower protein target (0.6 to 0.8g/kg/day) and a plant-forward protein source both show documented benefit over higher intake. The practical takeaway: 'more protein' is a reasonable, well-supported general goal for most healthy people, but not a universal rule, anyone with known kidney disease should follow the separate protein guidance for kidney disease instead.",

    teaser: 'A formal 6-week elimination plus 5-week reintroduction structure exists and is well-described, but the packaged protocol itself carries thinner direct trial evidence than several of the individual pieces it\'s built from.',
    summary: "The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP), a structured elimination diet developed specifically for autoimmune conditions, removes a defined list of foods (grains, legumes, dairy, nightshades, eggs, nuts and seeds, refined sugar, and food additives) for a set period, then reintroduces them one at a time to identify individual triggers. A published systematic review confirms the formal structure behind it: a 6-week elimination phase followed by a 5-week, one-food-at-a-time reintroduction protocol, the Healing Stages research draws directly on this same structure. Matching the established discipline for practitioner frameworks generally: AIP as a complete, packaged protocol carries thinner direct randomized-trial evidence than several of its individual components do on their own, the research finds strong, direct RCT evidence for a similar approach (a 1991 Lancet trial of fasting followed by a one-year vegetarian diet in RA specifically), and separate, strong evidence for individual AIP-adjacent pieces like gluten elimination in celiac disease. AIP is a legitimate, structured way to systematically test one's individual food triggers, not a single proven cure validated as one complete package, the same 'practitioner framework, evidence-graded piece by piece' standard already applied to its Healing Stages research.",

    summary: "'Fibermaxxing,' a current, informal name for deliberately increasing fiber intake to support gut health, isn't introducing a new, unproven claim, it's a current label for something the research already establishes as strong science. The Essential Nutrients research already documents a striking gap: roughly 94% of Americans don't meet the established fiber RDA (38 grams/day for men, 25 for women, ages 19-50), one of the largest, most consistent nutrient-intake shortfalls the research has found anywhere. The reason this matters directly ties to the gut-microbiome research: when gut bacteria ferment dietary fiber, they produce short-chain fatty acids, potent signaling molecules with independently-confirmed evidence (two separate studies, from two different research angles, reaching the same conclusion) of directly training the immune system toward tolerance rather than attack, described elsewhere as the single most food-controllable lever in its entire research base. 'Fibermaxxing' as a trend name is just a renewed push toward hitting an already-established, evidence-backed target most people are already falling well short of, not a new or unproven idea needing its separate justification.",

    summary: "'Gut-friendly eating,' incorporating prebiotics, probiotics, and fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi, and sourdough, is a current eating-style trend the Fermented Foods research backs with specific evidence. The research verifies specific bacterial strains by name (Lactobacillus reuteri, L. Gasseri, L. Plantarum, B. Coagulans, and others), each with individually cited effects, timing and fermentation-temperature requirements, and limitations (home fermentation offers no guaranteed CFU count or strain-identity verification the way a commercial, tested product does). Additional evidence covers fermented foods beyond yogurt directly: kimchi and sauerkraut-style brine ferments show a documented bacterial succession as they age, and traditional fermentation (soaking, sprouting) measurably reduces phytates, documented anti-nutrients that otherwise block mineral absorption. 'Gut-friendly eating' as a current trend name maps onto specific strain-level research, a step beyond simply eating more fiber (the fibermaxxing entry), toward cultivating the specific bacteria that do the work.",

A 2024 umbrella review pooling data on nearly 10 million people found ultra-processed food consistently tied to 32 different adverse health outcomes, a broad, consistent finding. The research adds concrete scale: ultra-processed food's share of total US adult caloric intake rose from 53.5% in 2001-02 to 57.0% by 2017-18, with minimally-processed whole food specifically displaced, falling from 32.7% to 27.4% of calories over the same period, not simply extra calories added on top of an otherwise unchanged diet.

Whatever someone builds and logs, the Insights tab shows a direct nutrient breakdown against established DRI targets, whether that reveals a keto-style low-carb pattern, a vegan-style protein-and-B12 gap named in the vegan entry, or anything in between. For anyone tracking a specific condition too, the condition-specific food scoring layers on top of whatever eating style someone follows. The Trends tab then looks across those days: Pattern Finder sets logged foods beside symptoms and flares, Therapy Response follows a treatment over time, and the nutrient, weight and movement charts show the direction things are moving, however someone eats.",
