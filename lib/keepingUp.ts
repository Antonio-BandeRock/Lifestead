// Keeping Up, 2026-09-23. Phase 3 of the cross-app push, and the lens for
// the second audience: somebody whose reason for opening this app is that
// daily life will not stay in their head. They already have capture,
// reminders, routines and Did I Do It. Nothing until now told them how any
// of it has been going.
//
// Five readings, all of them from records the app already keeps:
//
//   1. Did I Do It, from done_checks and done_check_marks.
//   2. Routine walks, from routine_runs.
//   3. What the capture inbox took in and let out, from capture_notes.
//   4. Upkeep done on time against done late, from upkeep_doings.
//   5. How work has been, from work_checkins.
//
// TWO RULES HOLD THE WHOLE FILE UP.
//
// FIRST, A PERIOD WITH NOTHING RECORDED IS A GAP, NEVER A ZERO. Carried
// forward from lib/eatingVariety.ts, where it was settled: a week somebody
// was too busy to log still happened. So every periodic figure here is
// `number | null`, a blank period says so in words, and the count of blank
// periods sits beside the headline. It also rules out a line chart for any
// of these series, since a line either joins across the blank, inventing a
// period, or plants it on zero.
//
// SECOND, NOTHING HERE SCORES ANYBODY. A missed day is a fact about the
// record, not a verdict on the person, and the wording everywhere says what
// was recorded rather than how well somebody did. The one place this is
// easy to get wrong is Did I Do It, where an unmarked day and a day the
// thing was done without being marked look identical in the table. Where
// that matters the sentence says what is known instead of guessing.
//
// No imports beyond the week arithmetic, so scripts/test_keeping_up.js can
// run the whole thing without a database.
