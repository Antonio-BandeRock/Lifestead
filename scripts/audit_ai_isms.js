// AI-isms: the tics that make writing read as machine-written, and the
// standing check that keeps them out of this app.
//
// 2026-09-18, direct instruction, after reading a Digest entry titled
// "Autism, ADHD and Dyslexia Are Here for Two Honest Reasons, and Neither
// of Them Is Treatment" whose summary opened "This app covers autism, ADHD
// and dyslexia for two reasons, and it is worth naming both plainly before
// anything else in this topic is read":
//
//   "The part that says 'and it is worth naming both plainly before
//   anything else in this topic is read' is 100% AI crap that is NOT
//   needed ever to be said, ever. The two things they need to know are
//   stated right after that. HUmans do not talk this way. They just say
//   'This app covers autism, ADHD and Dyslexia for two reasons. The first,
//   is nutritional: ...'  I do not want any AI-isms popping up in this app
//   anywhere ever, and I need you to stop putting these things into it at
//   all."
//
// This file is the machine half of that. The rules already written down in
// CLAUDE.md (no em dashes, no "real"/"genuine"/"genuinely", no redundant
// "own") were rules a person had to remember, and they kept not being
// remembered. A rule that is checked by a script is a different kind of
// rule.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS A HIT. Every pattern below is a thing that, in this app's
// customer-facing writing, is either (a) commentary about the writing
// rather than the writing, (b) a rhetorical shape that announces itself,
// or (c) a word nobody says out loud. Each carries a fix note saying what
// to do about it, because "flagged" without "so do this" just moves the
// problem.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A HIT. Ordinary prose that happens to contain a
// flagged word in a different sense, quoted material from a cited source
// (a trial's own title keeps its wording), and code comments explaining
// mechanism to a future reader. Comments are scanned separately and
// reported at a lower tier, because a comment is not something anybody
// using this app will ever see.
