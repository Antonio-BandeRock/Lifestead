// Shown when the database cannot be set up, so the app is not simply dead.
//
// Built 2026-09-06, after exactly that happened. 1.0.34.30 shipped a schema
// statement that threw on every device that already had the app. The throw was
// already caught and logged in app/_layout.tsx, and nothing was done with it, so
// the app carried on with a database that had never finished being built: Home
// was empty, Profile would not open, and there was no way to reach Check for
// Updates to pull the fix. Reported directly, and fairly: "This is not good."
//
// THE ONE JOB THIS SCREEN HAS. Not to explain, not to diagnose, not to look
// reassuring. To keep the update mechanism reachable when everything that
// depends on the database is gone, because an update is how a bad release
// actually gets fixed on a phone somebody is holding.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
//
// It touches no database, obviously, but that is worth stating because it is
// easy to break later: no profile name, no theme preference read, no saved
// anything. Colours come from constants/colors.ts, which resolves the ground
// theme synchronously from a plain text mirror file rather than from SQLite
// (see getGroundThemeSync), so this screen still renders correctly themed with
// the database completely unavailable.
//
// And it does not pretend the problem is the person's. It says the app failed,
// shows the real error, and offers the two things that genuinely help.
