// Richest foods for a nutrient, picked from inside a builder (G10, 2026-09-27).
//
// A builder's ingredient chooser gains a fourth way in beside Say a Food
// Name, My Food Products and Whole Foods: pick a nutrient, see the foods
// richest in it per 100 g, tap one and it goes into the dish the same way a
// food found by browsing does. It is Insights > Nutrient Ranking brought to
// the moment somebody is choosing what to put in.
//
// Three things narrow the list, each for a reason:
//  1. Only the categories the builder takes (the SQL does this, through
//     rankFoodsByNutrient's categories argument), so a smoothie is not
//     offered a steak.
//  2. The person's diet and allergies, the same checks Nutrient Ranking uses,
//     and the count left out is said rather than hidden.
//  3. A cap, so the list stays quick to read and to draw.
//
// Pure: no database and no React, so scripts/test_nutrient_rich_picks.js
// checks it directly. Nothing here says a food is good for anybody; the
// amount per 100 g is the whole claim.
