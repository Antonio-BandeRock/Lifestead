// lets four numbers per nutrient (name, amount, target, status) be scanned
// at a glance instead of read one at a time.
//
// At "Whole Day" scope, every nutrient is judged against today's target
// (deficient/low/adequate/excess risk) -- that judgment is meaningful for a
// full day's intake. Below the day level, a single food/side/meal isn't
// "deficient" in Vitamin C just because it's not the whole day's supply of
// it -- that's a category error, not a finding. So sub-day scopes drop the
// status judgment/coloring entirely and just show what fraction of today's
// target that scope contributed, sorted by biggest contributor first, with
// only nutrients this scope actually contains listed at all.
// The raw data behind a scope's own nutrient total: which specific logged
// foods (and, at day scope, supplements) actually produced it, sorted
// highest-contributor first. Reuses the same resolveScopeMeal/
// resolveScopeSide walkers already built for the scope navigator itself,
// so this can never disagree with whatever scope is currently selected.
// Direct fix for a real report: "the numbers don't really relate to
// understandable usable information... it doesn't tell me what the food
// is" -- a bare "Iron: 18%" row told a person nothing they could actually
// act on without manually re-drilling through ScopeHub one level at a

// A floating third hub button (see components/LensHub.tsx/TabHub.tsx for
// the same family of controls) -- opening a "you are here" trail plus a
// list of what's one level deeper. This is the navigation shared by all
// three lenses, so drilling from the whole day down to one ingredient is
// always a short, undoable series of taps instead of a wall of nested,
// simultaneously-expanded accordions. Was previously an inline row at the
// top of each lens's own content; moved into its own floating popup (same
// reasoning as LensHub replacing the old inline tab-pill row) so it
// doesn't eat vertical space from the actual data, and so it's reachable
// one-handed exactly like the other two hubs regardless of scroll
// position.
//
// 2026-07-25: moved from the screen's true bottom-left corner into the
// slot immediately left of TabHub (useSecondaryHubPosition(0)) -- that
// corner now belongs to LensHub's own button, redesigned to double as a
// "which tab am I in" marker, which only makes sense anchored at the true
// corner. This is the swap that made room for it.
//
// 2026-07-28: bumped from slot 0 to slot 1 -- slot 0 (closest to the
// butterfly) now belongs to MyItemsHub's own "My Insights" button, the
// same shortcut every other Lens page also gets in that exact spot. This
// button just shifts one slot further out to make room, same idea as the
// swap that first put it here.
//
// First bumped from slot 1 to slot 0, 2026-08-15 -- a real fix, but an
// incomplete one, corrected the same day once actually reported again:
// "the circle thing is behind the My Insights icon." Slot 0's own
// unclamped position (windowWidth/2 - 102) genuinely does clear LensHub's
// corner button, which is all that got checked at the time -- but
// MyItemsHub (the "My Insights" button, see MyItemsHub.tsx) doesn't use
// the slot system at all; it sits at the live midpoint of the gap between
// LensHub's own right edge and TabHub's own icon edge, which lands almost
// exactly where slot 0 does too (both formulas are independently trying to
// fill the same narrow strip). That's the real miss in the first fix --
// only LensHub's own clearance was re-checked, not MyItemsHub's.
//
// Worked out properly this time, not guessed at a third time: at ordinary
// phone widths the whole strip between the true left corner (16px in) and
// TabHub's own icon edge is only around 120-150px wide, and LensHub (60px)
// plus MyItemsHub (32px) plus a real, separate ScopeHub (60px) plus the
// gaps between them need at least ~150-175px -- there is genuinely no
// horizontal slot left in that strip for a third full-size button on any
// normal phone; every position tried (slot 0, slot 1) collides with
// whichever of LensHub/MyItemsHub it lands closest to. Fixed by moving
// ScopeHub OUT of that strip entirely rather than trying yet another
// position within it -- stacked directly above LensHub's own corner
// button (same `left`, `bottom` raised by one button-height plus one gap)
// instead of squeezed in beside it. Confirmed via direct math that nothing
// else renders in that vertical space (PageIdentityLabel -- the "which
// lens am I in" box -- sits on the opposite side of the screen from the
// hub cluster on purpose, see its own header comment) and that the new
// bottom position stays comfortably on-screen at every real device
// height.

// Nutrient Ranking lens, 2026-08-08 -- "a lens that is used to show food
// items based on how much of any specific thing is within them, such as
// to provide the list of foods in order of most protein to least, but
// separated by whether they are animal protein versus plant protein."
// Plain mapped rows, the same shape NutrientsTable/SixDsView above already
// use -- no FlatList needed at this scale (100 rows max, see
// rankFoodsByNutrient's own limit).
//
// 2026-08-14, direct report: "the field is at the top of the body of the
// app space and we are trying to make the app mostly capable of being
// fully operated from the chosen hand... Place the selector the way it is
// now and place it just above the footer top edge, and w[h]en something
// is selected from it, the results should be viewed just above the
// selector." Rebuilt from one plain scrolling column (label, field,
// results, all stacked top to bottom, the field reachable only by
// scrolling all the way up) into a real, two-zone layout: a scrollable
// results area filling the available space, and a fixed, non-scrolling
// field zone -- unchanged in its own look, per "place the selector the
// way it is now" -- pinned at the bottom, clearing the floating hub
// button/footer the exact same way the last item in any other lens' own
// scroll area already does (useFloatingButtonScrollPadding). This
// component now owns its own full layout, the same "not the shared page
// ScrollView" precedent Food Lookup already established, for the same
// real reason -- see this lens' own new branch in InsightsScreen's return.
//
// 2026-08-14, later the same day, real, on-device adb logcat evidence
// found this field's real ~15s row-tap freeze traced to an Android
// elevation/stacking conflict specifically with the floating TabHub
// button (see PopoverSelect.tsx's own `elevation` comment) -- the button
// was forced to always draw above other content, the popover wasn't, and
// they geometrically overlap right where this field sat, pinned above
// the footer. Raising the popover's own elevation past the button's
// fixed the worst of it (a confirmed 15s -> under 2s improvement), but a
// second real retest still showed a smaller, real 1-4s delay rather than
// the instant response every other PopoverSelect field in the app has.
// Moved back to the top of the ordinary scrolling column (the field-plus-
// results-both-in-one-column shape this lens originally had, before the
// bottom-pinned redesign described just above) as a real, direct
// diagnostic test -- removes proximity to that button as a variable
// entirely, rather than adding a third theory on top of two already-tried
// ones. Knowingly reintroduces the original one-handed-reach problem that
// motivated pinning it low in the first place (see InsightsScreen's own
// render, this lens' branch) -- an accepted, deliberate tradeoff for the
// duration of this specific test, not a final layout decision either way.
//
// 2026-08-14, same day, two more real, direct requests, both handled here:
// "we need a secondary filter for Nutrient ranking. It needs to separate
// raw food from dried, and from canned, and from any other way that makes
// it so we end up with an apples to apples way of looking at the food. And
// then, the user should be able to select any specific food to see how it
// ranks in other nutrients, such as 50th in vegetables or 35th in fruit."
// A real, second mode (`mode`) added alongside the original "pick a
// nutrient" one, sharing one prep-state filter (`prepGroup`) between both
// -- see rankFoodsByNutrient/getFoodRankingsAcrossNutrients's own header
// comments in lib/db.ts for the real, checked reasoning behind the six
// real prep-state groups, and for why this filter is genuinely NOT
// auto-applied based on a picked food's own prep state (a considered call,
// not an oversight -- see getFoodRankingsAcrossNutrients's own comment).

          footer/floating TabHub button -- a real, direct diagnostic test,
          not a permanent redesign decision on its own: on-device evidence
          traced the field row's own ~15s row-tap freeze to an Android
          elevation/stacking conflict specifically with that button (see
          PopoverSelect.tsx's own `elevation` comment), and raising the
          popover's elevation past the button's fixed the worst of it -- but
          a real retest still showed a smaller, real ~1-4s delay rather
          than the instant response every OTHER PopoverSelect field in the
          app has. Moving the field back into the ordinary top-of-page flow
          removes proximity to that button as a variable entirely, the most
          direct way to confirm whether it's still playing any role at all.
          If this reads as fully instant here, that's real, added
          confirmation; if the same delay follows the field up here, that's
          real, decisive evidence the elevation fix wasn't the whole story
          and something else is still going on. Bottom padding
          (fieldBottomPadding, now applied to this ScrollView's own content

          button for whatever's rendered last -- now the results table,
