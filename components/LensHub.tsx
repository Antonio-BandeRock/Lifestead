// matching `pageTitle` against TAB_ROUTES), enlarged, tinted in that tab's

// active pill -- color is reinforcement here, not the only signal.
// Anchored to the screen's true bottom-left corner (useBottomLeftHubPosition)

                (a ScrollView with shorter-than-container content simply
                doesn't scroll) -- not gated behind a per-page flag. */}
