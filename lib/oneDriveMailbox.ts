// The mailbox, running on a OneDrive folder the person actually chose.
//
// WHAT CHANGES HERE AND WHAT DOES NOT. The carrier changes: bytes move through
// Microsoft Graph instead of a file handed over a share sheet. Nothing else
// does. The payload is still built by lib/partnerSync.ts, still honours the
// grants because that function reads them itself, still sealed by
// lib/partnerCrypto.ts so only the recipient can open it, still named and
// addressed by lib/syncInbox.ts, and still verified on arrival by the same four
// checks in lib/partnerTransfer.ts rather than a second copy of them. A carrier
// deciding what is allowed to be true before something is stored is exactly the
// drift this app keeps having to unpick.
//
// ONE FOLDER, EVERY PARTNER, AND LATER EVERY CHILD. A shared folder holds
// everybody's files at once, and incomingFilesFor is what stops one phone
// reading another person's mail: it matches the recipient half of the filename
// and drops anything addressed elsewhere, before anything is downloaded. The
// sealing would refuse it anyway, but a device that downloads and tries to open
// every file in a household folder is doing something it has no business doing.
//
// A FILE IS DELETED ONCE IT HAS BEEN APPLIED. What is in the folder is the
// latest thing somebody sent, not a history, and leaving read mail in a folder
// two people share means the same conditions get re-applied on every check with
// no way to tell a fresh send from an old one.
