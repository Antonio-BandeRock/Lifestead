// "What I have noticed" in a report (K6, 2026-09-29). What Pattern Finder
// turned up on Trends, and the leave-it-out-then-bring-it-back experiments
// on Signals, set down for a doctor or a nutritionist to read.
//
// Every line is a sentence the person already sees on screen, from
// lib/patternBasis.ts, lib/patternContext.ts and lib/foodExperiment.ts, so
// a clinician reads the same words and the same denominators, and each
// candidate is labelled a hypothesis from one person's records. Nothing
// here says a food causes anything, and the count a candidate is measured
// against stands beside it every time.
//
// Pure: lib/reportGenerator.ts reads the records and hands them over, and
// scripts/test_report_noticed.js checks this without a phone.
