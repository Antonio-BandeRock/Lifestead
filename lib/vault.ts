// The vault, the rules with no I/O in them (agreed 2026-10-06, phase 1 built
// 2026-10-07, phase 2 from 2026-10-07). Pure, so scripts/test_vault.js
// checks every decision without a phone.
//
// What it is: the part of a person's records that only a partner may ever
// see, kept closed while the app is open, so a phone left unlocked on the
// counter shows the shopping list and not the labs. It opens with the App
// Lock code or fingerprint, or with a code of its own when App Lock is off,
// and closes when the app is put away.
//
// What goes in it is the person's choice, one category at a time (direct
// instruction, 2026-10-07): "let the user decide what goes into the vault
// and what stays out." Everything HIPAA would treat as health information
// and everything about money is offered pre-ticked, and nothing is in the
// vault until somebody chooses it.
//
// Records, never tools. The vault holds what a person has stored, never the
// means of adding to it: a list of choices (the check-in tags a person made
// up), a template or a setting stays out, so every form works with the vault
// closed and only the history beside it says "in the vault".
//
// How it holds, two ways:
//
//  1. A RECORDS category is refused at the one place every read goes
//     through (attachWriteTracking in lib/databaseActivity.ts). A SELECT that
//     names one of its tables while the vault is closed is refused with
//     VaultClosedError before it reaches the database, the same way
//     SessionReadOnlyError refuses a write. Writing is never refused: a
//     check-in can be added with the vault closed, and it is then behind the
//     vault with the rest.
//
//  2. A LISTED category (medications, conditions, appointments) cannot be
//     refused at the database, because the app's tools read the same rows to
//     keep a person safe: the timing warnings read the medicines, food scoring
//     reads the conditions, the day's reminders read the appointments. Safety
//     is never hidden, by a tier or by the vault (P28). So those reads go on,
//     and the screens that SHOW the list (My Meds, the conditions list, the
//     appointments lens, past doses, a report's sections) ask
//     isCategoryClosed() and draw the band instead. Agreed 2026-10-07 with
//     the cost said out loud: a warning on a food screen still says "a
//     caution for your condition".
//
// A tool that must read a RECORDS table to work (a personal rule raising its
// warning, a family member's conditions joining the meal plan) marks its
// statement with VAULT_TOOL_READ. scripts/audit_vault_readers.js lists every
// file allowed to.
//
// The emergency card is never in the vault, by agreement: it has to be
// readable by whoever is helping.
