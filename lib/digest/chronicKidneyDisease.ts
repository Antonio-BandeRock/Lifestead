    summary:
      "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive loss of kidney function over months to years, most commonly caused by diabetes and high blood pressure. Current KDIGO clinical guidelines diagnose CKD using two distinct measures together: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, how well the kidneys filter blood) and albuminuria (protein leaking into urine, measured as a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, or ACR).\n\nA diagnosis requires either an eGFR under 60 mL/min per 1.73m² or an ACR of 30 mg/g or higher, present for at least three months, distinguishing chronic disease from a temporary, resolving kidney issue. Staging runs from G1 (eGFR 90 or above, normal or high function but with other damage markers present) down through G3a, G3b, G4, to G5 (eGFR under 15, kidney failure). This category covers what's specific to actually managing CKD day to day, and one of its most important findings directly challenges a piece of dietary advice repeated to nearly every CKD patient.",

    summary:
      "Restricting high-potassium foods (bananas, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes) is some of the most commonly repeated dietary advice given to CKD patients, and a direct check of the evidence behind it turns up a surprise: a 2017 review conducted for clinical guidelines found no actual trials evaluating dietary potassium restriction for managing hyperkalemia in CKD, and separate, more recent observational research found no association between dietary potassium intake and blood potassium levels in CKD populations at all. The 2020 KDIGO guidelines themselves went so far as to state the evidence was insufficient to support a graded recommendation either way.\n\nAn emerging, more specific picture has taken its place: some research now suggests a liberalized, plant-based, high-fiber dietary pattern may actually support healthier potassium regulation, since dietary fiber and other food-matrix factors can help shift potassium into cells and increase its excretion through the bowel rather than the kidneys. This is not a claim that potassium never matters in CKD, hyperkalemia is a serious risk, especially in more advanced disease or when combined with certain medications (see this category's dedicated entry). It's a correction: the specific, individual amount of dietary potassium restriction that's actually appropriate varies by person and by how advanced someone's CKD is, and a blanket \"avoid these foods\" list isn't well supported as a universal rule.",

    summary:
      "Phosphorus management is a central concern in CKD, since damaged kidneys can't clear excess phosphorus the way healthy ones do, and research finds an important distinction most general nutrition advice misses: not all dietary phosphorus behaves the same way in the body. Inorganic phosphate additives, used widely as preservatives in processed foods, fast food, canned and bottled drinks, and spreadable cheeses, are absorbed at over 90%, sometimes described as approaching 100%.\n\nNatural, organic phosphorus in whole plant foods, by contrast, is absorbed at only 20% to 50% (largely because it's bound in a form called phytate that the human digestive system can't fully break down), and even organic phosphorus in animal-based whole foods is absorbed at a more moderate 40% to 60%.\n\nThe practical problem: unlike sodium, added phosphorus content isn't consistently required on nutrition labels, which is exactly why researchers describe it as \"hidden phosphorus.\" This is a meaningfully different concern from just \"how much phosphorus is in this food\", a minimally processed, naturally phosphorus-containing food and a processed food with additive phosphorus can carry a very different actual absorbed burden even at similar total phosphorus content on paper.",

    summary:
      "Low-protein diets are a standard part of managing moderate-to-advanced CKD, with research linking them to reduced proteinuria, better blood pressure control, and a slower decline in kidney function in both diabetic and non-diabetic CKD. The specific, commonly recommended range is 0.6 to 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, a meaningful reduction from typical intake, not just a vague \"cut back\" suggestion.\n\nA more recent and specific finding adds a further layer: research comparing plant-based to animal-based low-protein diets finds plant-based approaches superior on several measured outcomes in advanced CKD, better nitrogen balance, better acid-base regulation, fewer uremic toxins produced, and a more favorable ratio of unsaturated to saturated fat.\n\nAn ongoing randomized trial (the PLADO protocol) is specifically testing a plant-dominant low-protein diet (at least half of protein from plant sources) against standard renal-diet care in CKD stages 3 through 5. A low-protein diet done well is a specific, structured intervention, best undertaken with a dietitian's guidance given the risk of malnutrition if protein is reduced without enough total calories or the right food choices to fill the gap.",

    summary:
      "As CKD progresses, the kidneys' own ability to properly balance the body's acid-base chemistry declines, producing a common complication called metabolic acidosis, which itself is linked to faster kidney function decline and muscle wasting. A meaningful body of trial evidence supports a simple, low-cost intervention: a review of 14 randomized controlled trials (2,037 patients total) found oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation improved measured kidney function (eGFR) and increased muscle mass in CKD patients with this complication.\n\nA dedicated trial (the UBI Study, CKD stages 3-5, 36 months) specifically tested whether correcting this acid-base imbalance preserved kidney function over the longer term, adding to the broader evidence base.

The CREDENCE trial found canagliflozin reduced the combined risk of kidney failure, doubling of creatinine, or kidney/cardiovascular death by 30% in CKD patients with type 2 diabetes, the first SGLT2 inhibitor trial specifically built around a kidney-disease outcome.\n\nThe landmark DAPA-CKD trial then found dapagliflozin produced a 39% relative risk reduction in kidney-disease progression, and, notably, this benefit held in CKD patients without diabetes too, not just those with it, meaning the kidney-protective effect is independent of the drug's original blood-sugar-lowering purpose. Further trials (EMPA-KIDNEY) have since confirmed this same kidney benefit with a second drug in the same class.

      "Anemia in CKD has a dual cause, and the kidneys themselves are directly responsible for the first half of it: they produce roughly 90% of the body's erythropoietin, the hormone that signals bone marrow to make red blood cells, so as kidney function declines, that signal weakens. Prevalence data tracks directly with disease stage: anemia affects about 17.4% of people in CKD stage 3, rising to 50.3% in stage 4, and 53.4% in stage 5. The second, separate contributing cause is iron deficiency, common on its own in CKD (present in a striking 68.6% of anemic female CKD patients and 53.8% of anemic male patients in one study), driven partly by impaired gut iron absorption.\n\nOne gap: despite how common and well-understood this complication is, treatment rates remain low, with one study finding only about 40% of anemic CKD patients receiving erythropoietin treatment and just 27% receiving iron.

Risk of CKD's complications rises step by step with worse categories of both measures together, not just one, which is exactly why complete monitoring tracks both rather than either alone.

    summary: "ACE inhibitors and ARBs are first-line medications for CKD, especially when protein is present in the urine, and carry kidney-protective benefit. They also carry a direct effect: both classes tend to raise blood potassium and can reduce eGFR somewhat when first started, the same mechanism behind this category's separate correction on dietary potassium restriction, and the same broad hyperkalemia risk the PCOS research covers for spironolactone.\n\nCurrent KDIGO guidance gives a specific, practical answer to managing that risk rather than avoiding these medications out of caution alone: check both eGFR and potassium within one week of starting or increasing the dose, regardless of the starting potassium level, then continue monitoring every three to six months under normal circumstances, and again during any acute illness.\n\nResearch finds these medications underused in exactly the patients who'd benefit most, partly out of reluctance over this same manageable risk. A brief rise in potassium or a modest early eGFR dip after starting one of these medications isn't automatically a reason to stop it, both are expected, trackable, and, per guidance, don't call for discontinuing the medication on their own.",

Kolff's device still had a serious limitation: it required sacrificing a blood vessel for every single treatment, making repeated, ongoing dialysis impractical. That problem wasn't solved until 1960, when Wayne Quinton and Belding Scribner developed a reusable vascular access method in Seattle, the final piece that made CHRONIC (not just emergency) dialysis possible, opening the door to the ongoing kidney-replacement therapy still used today.",

Current guidance for people on dialysis calls for MORE protein, not less, to replace what treatment itself takes out.\n\nPotassium and fluid restriction, by contrast, often intensify rather than reverse: someone on standard three-times-weekly hemodialysis has longer stretches between treatments for waste and fluid to build back up, meaning strict limits on both often become necessary in a way they weren't pre-dialysis.

    teaser: 'A systematic review found current NSAID use raising acute kidney injury risk by about 73% in the general population and 63% in people who already have chronic kidney disease.',
    summary: "NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, and similar over-the-counter pain relievers) carry a quantified acute kidney injury (AKI) risk, not just a vague caution. A systematic review and meta-analysis found the pooled odds of AKI with current NSAID use in the general population at 1.73 (a 73% relative increase), rising to 2.51 in older adults specifically.\n\nIn people who already have chronic kidney disease, the pooled risk was 1.63 (a 63% relative increase), with individual studies ranging as high as 5.25 depending on the population studied. Research finds NSAID-induced AKI itself is a strong, independent risk factor for the actual development and progression of chronic kidney disease, not just a temporary, reversible blip, meaning a single episode of NSAID-related kidney injury can have lasting consequences.\n\nThe underlying mechanism involves NSAIDs blocking prostaglandins the kidneys depend on to maintain healthy blood flow, causing vasoconstriction and, in some cases, direct interstitial inflammation. This connects straight to the diuretic/prescribing-cascade research for a different condition, since NSAIDs combined with diuretics or blood-pressure medications that affect the same kidney blood-flow pathway carry an additional, compounding risk, worth naming directly with a doctor or pharmacist for anyone managing CKD who reaches for an NSAID regularly.",

    summary: "Chronic kidney disease has a direct gut-microbiome connection that goes beyond diet alone: two specific compounds, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, are gut-bacteria-manufactured uremic toxins, produced when certain gut bacteria (from families like Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae) ferment protein, and they accumulate in the blood as declining kidney function loses the ability to clear them.\n\nResearch finds their accumulation directly promotes oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, contributing to vascular damage and elevated cardiovascular risk in CKD, connecting directly to the CKD cardiovascular-risk research. A related finding: CKD patients also show reduced levels of beneficial bacteria families, including Lactobacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, the same bacterial families covered favorably elsewhere in the gut-microbiome and fermented-foods research, alongside the rise in toxin-producing bacteria.\n\nEmerging interventions being studied to modulate this gut-kidney axis include dietary changes, prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, though none are yet standard clinical practice. This gives a mechanistic explanation for why the plant-forward, fiber-supportive dietary pattern already recommended elsewhere in the CKD protein-restriction research does double duty, supporting the same beneficial gut bacteria that compete against the toxin-producing ones, not just managing protein intake on its own.",

    summary: "Contrast dye, used to sharpen the images in a CT scan, carries a kidney injury risk specifically for anyone with existing chronic kidney disease, defined as a measurable worsening of kidney function within 24 to 48 hours of the procedure. First, the reassuring part: research finds the overall risk of this happening is minimal for most people undergoing routine CT imaging, one study of 1,666 subjects found contrast-induced nephropathy developing in just 3.7% of cases, even among a CKD population.\n\nResearch finds the risk concentrates specifically as kidney function drops further, rising noticeably once eGFR (covered in the self-advocacy research) falls below roughly 36.8 mL/min/1.73m², with diabetes and low blood albumin identified as additional risk factors. Practical reassurance: a prophylaxis program (proper hydration protocols before and after the scan) run over 8 years found contrast-induced nephropathy manageable in stable CKD patients when this prevention step was followed.\n\nResearch finds contrast-induced nephropathy itself didn't increase mortality, but patients who did develop it were significantly more likely to need dialysis within the following 6 months. This is worth raising before any contrast-enhanced CT scan for someone with CKD: hydration protocols and, in some cases, choosing a non-contrast alternative imaging method are established ways to manage this risk rather than avoid necessary imaging altogether.",

    summary: "Chronic kidney disease carries an independently documented risk for cognitive decline and dementia, beyond the more familiar cardiovascular and mineral-bone complications covered elsewhere in the CKD research. Research finds CKD one of the strongest risk factors for mild cognitive impairment and dementia in large, population-based studies, with its impact exceeded only by stroke and chronic anti-anxiety medication use in one 6-year study.\n\nDose-response data makes the pattern concrete: a study of 3,679 community-dwelling adults found new cognitive impairment rates of 5.8%, 9.9%, and 21.5% across three declining kidney-function groups, with the lowest-function group carrying a 2.14 times higher risk than the highest. Striking: research found people whose eGFR declined by 4 mL/min/1.73m² or more per year had a 5.35 times higher risk of developing vascular dementia over 7 years compared to those with a slower decline.\n\nProposed mechanisms include uremia-driven chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, vitamin D deficiency, anemia (covered in the CKD research), and impaired clearance of amyloid-beta, the same protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease.

      "Depression is a common and underrecognized companion to chronic kidney disease, carrying measurable consequences for the disease itself, not just quality of life. Research finds depression prevalence ranging from roughly a quarter to half of CKD patients depending on the study, with major depressive disorder specifically affecting about 20% of people with CKD or kidney failure.\n\nResearch finds this burden rises with disease severity, one study found depression in 29.9% of people on chronic hemodialysis versus 18.5% in earlier, pre-dialysis stages. Important: research finds depressive symptoms an underrecognized but potentially modifiable risk factor independently associated with faster CKD progression, kidney transplant failure, more hospitalizations, more cardiovascular events, and higher mortality, a direct link between mental health and physical disease outcome, not a separate, parallel concern.\n\nResearch finds a plausible, concrete mechanism behind part of this: depression can undermine a person's ability to stick with the dietary, fluid, and medication requirements CKD management demands. Clinical guidance explicitly calls depression a priority that current CKD management still doesn't give adequate attention to, someone with CKD experiencing persistent low mood, hopelessness, or loss of motivation for their self-care has an evidence-backed reason to raise it directly with their nephrology team, not treat it as a separate issue for a different doctor.",

      "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in CKD, well before kidney failure itself becomes the bigger threat, so a direct question worth answering is whether standard cholesterol-lowering treatment actually helps this specific population the way it helps the general population. The SHARP trial, the largest trial ever run on this question (9,270 participants, split between people with CKD not yet on dialysis and people already on it), tested simvastatin plus ezetimibe against placebo.\n\nThe headline result: a 0.85 mmol/L average LDL reduction tracked with a 17% reduction in major atherosclerotic events (heart attack, stroke, and the need for an artery-opening procedure) across the trial as a whole. This is directly relevant to anyone already on dialysis: subgroup analysis found the benefit was clearly present in the earlier-stage CKD group but less certain in the dialysis-dependent group specifically, a limitation this trial's authors and later reviews have both noted rather than glossed over. This is large-scale evidence that cholesterol management remains a worthwhile part of CKD care for most people with the condition, though its strength varies by how advanced the kidney disease already is, a concrete reason to ask directly where a specific treatment's evidence is strongest for a given stage of CKD.",

    summary:
      "The G-A staging system uses one fixed eGFR threshold (60) to define CKD, regardless of age. Large-scale data finds a problem with that: kidney filtration rate declines as a normal, expected part of aging, even with no kidney disease present, and an analysis of over 1.5 million healthy Europeans found a substantial share of people over 65 already score below that same standard threshold, evidence the 90th percentile of eGFR at age 65 sits at only 90, meaning most healthy 65-year-olds are already well below what a younger adult would consider normal, let alone the CKD cutoff itself.\n\nSome nephrologists argue this leads to overdiagnosis in older adults, with a separate large study finding people over 65 with a mildly reduced eGFR (45-59) and little to no protein in their urine had a risk of death similar to, and higher than, their risk of ever actually reaching kidney failure, suggesting the label itself may carry more alarm than the actual biological reality warrants for many older adults. This is a still-unsettled debate, not a case with one clearly right answer, some proposals call for age-adjusted eGFR percentiles instead of one fixed number.

      "Nearly everything else in this category ties CKD to a familiar cause, diabetes, high blood pressure, or an autoimmune process. A distinct, regionally concentrated form doesn't. Chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKDu) is a documented epidemic striking agricultural communities specifically in Central America (El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, often called Mesoamerican nephropathy when it affects Pacific-coast sugarcane workers) and Sri Lanka, and its defining feature is that it occurs WITHOUT the standard risk factors, no diabetes, no hypertension, no glomerulonephritis, a meaningfully different disease pattern from typical CKD.\n\nThe damaged tissue pattern (chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with scarring) also looks different under the microscope than typical diabetic or hypertensive kidney damage. Research points to a converging set of regional risk factors rather than one single cause: repeated heat stress from physical labor in a hot climate, dehydration, pesticide and other agrochemical exposure, and possibly heavy metals or contaminated drinking water, with poverty itself compounding the cumulative exposure.\n\nFor anyone doing sustained heavy outdoor labor in a hot climate, especially in these specific regions, standard CKD risk factors (diet, blood sugar, blood pressure) don't fully capture the picture, and adequate hydration and heat protection during work are themselves a protective factor, though still incompletely understood.",

An analysis pooling multiple studies found kidney transplantation carrying a hazard ratio of 0.45 against dialysis, meaning a roughly 55% lower risk of death, and direct, matched comparisons confirm it in concrete numbers: 92% of transplant recipients were alive at 5 years and 87% at 10 years, against 88% and 74% for closely matched dialysis patients over the same periods.\n\nOne complication: this benefit isn't immediate. In the first months after surgery, transplant recipients actually face a higher short-term mortality risk than dialysis patients, driven mainly by infection risk from the immune-suppressing medications transplant requires, before the survival curves cross and transplant's large advantage takes over, typically becoming clearly apparent by around 9 months out.\n\nThe benefit holds even in older adults, one study of patients over 70 found 38% lower mortality and 80% five-year survival for transplant recipients versus 53% for those who stayed on dialysis.

      "Beyond the protein, sodium, and mineral concerns, research finds a symptom that's common but often goes unrecognized as CKD-related at all: chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus, persistent, whole-body or localized itching with no other clear skin cause. Prevalence data finds it affecting roughly 20 percent of people with earlier-stage CKD, climbing to 40 percent (and, in some studies, up to 80 percent) of people on hemodialysis, with roughly 40 percent of dialysis patients reporting the itching as moderate to severe rather than mild. The direct mechanism isn't fully settled, but it's now understood to involve systemic changes, an imbalance in the body's opioid-receptor signaling, low-grade inflammation, and mineral/bone changes, not simply dry skin.\n\nThe practical stakes go beyond comfort: research directly links CKD-associated pruritus to worse sleep quality, and the itching itself is independently associated with a higher mortality risk in dialysis patients. This is a name-able, discussable symptom, not something to quietly tolerate as an unavoidable part of kidney disease, and dedicated treatments (including an FDA-approved medication specifically for it) now exist.",

    summary:
      "The potassium research found blanket restriction thinner on evidence than assumed, sodium is a different story. A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in adults with stage 3-4 CKD and hypertension found that restricting dietary sodium produced a statistically significant average blood-pressure reduction of 10 systolic and 4 diastolic points, alongside measured reductions in fluid retention and albuminuria (protein leaking into urine, an marker of kidney damage).\n\nThe study's authors found this effect size larger than what's typically reported in sodium-restriction trials in people without CKD, direct evidence that CKD patients tend to be more salt-sensitive than the general population, not equally so. A separate self-management-support trial found a practical result too: coaching patients to manage their sodium intake dropped systolic blood pressure from an average of 140 to 132 over three months. Alongside this category's potassium correction: unlike potassium, sodium-restriction evidence in CKD specifically is solid, not just extrapolated from general population data.",

    summary:
      "The mineral and bone research names cardiovascular risk from mineral-bone disorder, and secondary hyperparathyroidism is the specific mechanism most directly driving it. Healthy kidneys perform the final activation step converting vitamin D into its active hormone form; as CKD progresses, that activation declines, and the resulting drop in active vitamin D and calcium triggers the parathyroid glands to release excess parathyroid hormone in compensation, itself a driver of bone loss and cardiovascular calcification over time. A large observational study of 376 patients across 15 US nephrology clinics compared real-world outcomes of extended-release calcifediol against other vitamin D therapies for this exact condition.\n\nA separate randomized trial found something more complicated than a straightforward fix: adding active vitamin D on top of extended-release calcifediol did further lower parathyroid hormone, but the same combination was also associated with a faster decline in kidney function itself over the 38-week trial period, a tradeoff between controlling one complication and protecting the kidney further. This is an actively managed area of nephrology where the right vitamin D approach depends on where someone sits along the CKD staging, not a one-size-fits-all supplement recommendation.",

The FIND-CKD trial, a 56-week, 626-patient randomized study, compared intravenous ferric carboxymaltose against oral iron in non-dialysis CKD patients with iron-deficiency anemia and found the IV group reached higher hemoglobin levels faster and required fewer additional treatments, evidence of an efficacy gap, not just a convenience difference.\n\nA separate 351-patient trial comparing iron isomaltoside against oral iron sulfate found the IV formulation not just non-inferior but superior in sustained hemoglobin increase from week 3 through the end of the 8-week study. The likely mechanism connects directly to the gut research: CKD's inflammatory state can impair how well the gut actually absorbs oral iron, meaning a pill that works fine for iron deficiency in a healthy gut may simply not be absorbed as reliably once kidney-disease-related inflammation is present.\n\nAlongside this advantage, oral iron remains a reasonable first option for milder deficiency given its lower cost and no infusion visit required, but trial evidence supports asking directly about IV iron when oral iron isn't correcting anemia as expected, rather than assuming a higher oral dose alone will eventually work.",

The direct mechanism connects to the anemia and iron research: reduced kidney clearance and inflammation elevate iron-regulating hormones in hemodialysis patients, direct evidence lowering serum iron levels and impairing how the brain itself uses iron, a plausible pathway to RLS specifically.\n\nThe most serious finding: RLS in this population isn't just an uncomfortable symptom, research links it to insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, and depression, and, more seriously, to an increased risk of cardiovascular events and death.

This is a wide range reflecting variation across different studies and populations, but even the low end represents a meaningful share of patients affected.\n\nThe serious stakes: the same review found inappropriate prescribing associated with increased hospital stays and a 40 percent higher mortality risk, a serious consequence from something as preventable as a standard, unadjusted dose. Matching the example (opioid accumulation in end-stage kidney disease requiring dose reduction), this is a systemic, common problem, not a rare prescribing mistake, worth directly and proactively asking any new prescriber whether a given medication's dose has been checked against current kidney function (eGFR, covered elsewhere in this category's self-advocacy research), rather than assuming every prescription automatically accounts for it.",

For uremic pruritus, a network meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials covering 1,969 patients found acupuncture and related point-stimulation methods improved itching against control. Now the line that matters.\n\nSeveral review articles in this literature go on to state that acupuncture improves renal function, reduces proteinuria, and corrects anemia in chronic kidney disease. Those are narrative reviews rather than controlled trials, they are a far larger claim than symptom relief, and nothing here supports them. Treat these therapies as something to raise with a nephrology team for symptoms that are not otherwise controlled, and expect no effect on the kidneys themselves.",

    teaser:
      'Blood urea nitrogen fell in a four-week feeding trial, and so did uric acid and IGF-1. Nobody in the trial had kidney disease, and no kidney outcome was measured.',
    summary:
      "A controlled feeding study put 20 healthy adults (11 women, 9 men) through three four-week periods, restricting either methionine alone or methionine together with cysteine. Restricting both lowered body weight, total cholesterol, LDL, uric acid, leptin, insulin, blood urea nitrogen and IGF-1, and raised body temperature and plasma FGF-21. Restricting methionine alone moved fewer markers, with blood urea nitrogen, uric acid and 8-isoprostane falling and FGF-21 rising.\n\nThe researchers reported no adverse effects and declared no conflicts of interest. The blood urea nitrogen result is the one worth being careful about. Urea is what the body makes when it breaks protein down, so blood urea nitrogen falls when protein intake falls whether or not anything about the kidney has changed. It is a marker that moves with diet, not a measurement of how well a kidney is filtering, and eGFR and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio are what answer that question. Nobody in this trial had chronic kidney disease, the trial ran four weeks, every meal came from a research kitchen, and no kidney outcome was followed.\n\nThe 2026 mouse work in the same area points at the risk in the other direction: when methionine was dropped to the lowest level tested, the animals lost weight fast enough that the researchers had to step in, and the study settled on a higher level to keep weight stable. In chronic kidney disease the protein target is set with a nephrology team, because too little protein carries a documented cost in muscle loss and frailty, and the evidence that does exist is about the level and the source rather than about one amino acid.",
