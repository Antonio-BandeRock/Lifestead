// Your Story as an interview, 1.0.52.5. Direct instruction, 2026-09-25:
// "The app requires them to input their conditions, their neurodivergences
// or not, their interest on where THEY want to start using the app, and with
// a focus on providing the app with the things it needs such as their
// prescriptions, supplements, where they are with their condition(s), if
// they need to follow any certain eating style, or if they are interested in
// following one, explaining each style of eating for them to make an
// informed decision. and the app needs to tell them about what each tab is
// meant to do for them. Configure this sort of like the app answering
// interview questions. I don't want it to focus immediately on one little
// aspect of the whole tab, I want it to tell the user what they can do with
// all of the Life tab or all of the Food tab, etc."
//
// Two halves:
//   the questions  asked one at a time, in the order the app needs the
//                  answers. A question is answered by its record (a
//                  condition chosen, a stage set, a medicine listed) or, for
//                  an answer that leaves no record anywhere else ("none of
//                  these", "not sure yet", the tab to start from), by a row
//                  in your_story_answers. Nothing here stores "done".
//   the tour       what each of the nine tabs is for as a whole, its lenses
//                  in named groups, and a few ways to get started, the tab
//                  chosen to start from first.
//
// The rules Your Story keeps hold here too: no numbering, no percentage, no
// praise or blame, nothing claimed about a cause, and no eating style
// described as treating anything.
//
// Pure, imports nothing at runtime but lib/yourStory.ts, and covered by
// scripts/test_your_story.js.
