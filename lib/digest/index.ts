// reference database). Matches against everything a person would actually
// recognize a topic by: the title/food name and one-line teaser (what
// shows on the collapsed card), the full summary/problem/mechanism/swaps
// text (so a search for a specific mechanism like "zonulin" or

// journal name works too).
//
// 2026-08-21, found and fixed directly: the comment this replaced claimed
// "with only a few hundred entries total, no indexing or debouncing is
// needed for this to feel instant" -- true when written, no longer true.
// ALL_DIGEST_ENTRIES is built from 40 separate source arrays now, and one
// single session (the fermented-drinks workstream: 45 recipes, 19
// condition entries, several Basic Health entries) added roughly 68 more,
// several genuinely long. Search All's own debounce (useDebouncedValue,
// already built once before for exactly this class of complaint) still
// only lets the expensive part run after typing pauses, but that
// expensive part itself was redoing real, wasted work every single time:
// every entry's own title/citation/summary text got rejoined and
// re-lowercased from scratch on every debounced search call, even though
// ALL_DIGEST_ENTRIES is a static module-level constant that never
// changes at runtime. A WeakMap keyed by the entry object itself computes
// each entry's own searchable text exactly once (lazily, on first use),
// so every search after the first reuses it instead of repeating the same
// string work over an entry pool that's only grown.
//
// 2026-10-26, Spanish first: when the app is in another language, the
// translation of each searched field is added beside its English (see
// lib/digest/searchLanguage.ts), and both the text and the query are
// compared without accents, so "proteina" finds "proteína". The cache
// remembers which language it was built in and rebuilds an entry once the
// language changes.

// a bad reaction to horchata but I can eat rice dishes without a
// problem?") and get back whatever this Digest's own real entries say
// that's most relevant, not nothing at all because the exact phrase never
// appears verbatim anywhere. Every real content word (see
// extractSearchTerms above) is checked independently now -- an entry needs
// to match at least ONE of them, not all of them, and results are sorted
// by how many terms actually matched (title matches count 3x an ordinary
// body/citation match, so an entry literally about the thing being asked
// about outranks one that just happens to mention it once in passing).
// This is still a real, honest search over this app's own already-written
// content, not a generated answer -- see this app's own recorded
// architecture decision (2026-08-08) for why a real AI-summarized-answer
// version of this was deliberately NOT built: it would mean a person's own
// typed health question leaving the device to reach an external API, a
// real, first-time departure from this app's whole local-first design that
// needs its own dedicated conversation before ever being built, not folded
// into this pass.
//
