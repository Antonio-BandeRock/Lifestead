// Keeps this device in step with the other one while the app runs.
//
// Mounted once in app/_layout.tsx after the database is ready. Renders
// the dialogs it needs and, while the other device has the session, a
// strip across the top of the screen with Take Over Now.
//
// ONE DEVICE AT A TIME (1.0.57.11, lib/syncSession.ts). Until then this
// looked at the folder every half minute and saved eight seconds after
// every write, on both devices, all day: "That seems like quite a lot of
// unnecessary traffic." Now one device has the session, and:
//
//   - At startup, and every time the app comes to the front (or, on the
//     desktop app, its window gains focus): reads the session note. If
//     the other device was used in the last half hour, this device waits:
//     read only, with the strip, and nothing of its own is saved. What
//     the other device saves is still taken in (1.0.60.17), so the copy
//     being read is the latest one rather than one from before the other
//     device picked the session up. If not, this device takes in whatever the other one saved (the merge,
//     lib/snapshotMerge.ts, exactly as before), claims the session and
//     saves anything of its own that is unsaved.
//   - While it has the session: writes that it is in use no more than
//     every five minutes, and saves a few minutes after writing stops
//     (SESSION_SAVE_QUIET_MS) and at once when the app is put away.
//   - While it waits: a timer set for the moment the half hour is up
//     reads the note once more. The desktop app also reads it every
//     minute, which costs nothing there since the OneDrive client keeps
//     the folder on the disk, so a takeover from the phone is seen
//     without the window having to lose and regain focus. A phone never
//     reads it on a timer of its own apart from that one.
//   - Take Over Now claims the session at once and takes in the other
//     device's latest copy.
//
// A device that notices the session has come free while nobody is
// using it (the timer) takes in the other device's copy but does not
// claim the session, since claiming is for somebody using this device,
// and the restart that can follow a merge is marked quiet so the check
// after it does not claim either. Otherwise a computer left open would
// shut the phone out every half hour.
//
// A folder that cannot be reached is said once per run rather than left
// on Profile's Backup & Restore card for somebody to find (1.0.42.30).
// The note being unreachable does not shut this device out: it goes on
// as if nobody held the session, and the merge covers the rest.
//
// On the desktop app "foreground" and "background" come from the window
// gaining and losing focus, since react-native-web's AppState follows the
// document's visibility, which changes only on minimize (1.0.42.29).
//
// The first-time question says what changed on each side (the words come
// from lib/snapshotChanges.ts); every merge after that goes to the log
// quietly (lib/syncLog.ts, ANNOUNCE_MERGES in lib/snapshotSync.ts).
// Checks and saves run one at a time, in the order they were asked for.
//
// WHEN A MERGE RESTARTS THE APP (1.0.60.14). Reported from the computer:
// "after about 2 minutes of being open, it restarted itself again." The
// phone's half hour ran out while the computer sat open, the expiry check
// took in the phone's changes, and the app restarted under the person's
// hands; with App Lock on, every such restart also asks to be unlocked
// again. So a merge restarts at once only at startup and on Take Over Now,
// when nothing is on screen yet worth keeping. Any other time a strip says
// what came in, with Refresh Now, and the restart waits for the app to be
// put away. With App Lock on it waits for the app to lock instead, since
// locking reloads the app anyway and a restart on leaving would greet the
// person with the lock screen.
