// Self Advocacy -- added 2026-08-07, direct request, prompted by a real
// Google-search summary the person's wife had found and shared: "How to
// self advocate for full panel tests to be done... explain why each type
// of test is useful to a person with Hashimoto's and how often they should
// be tested for the data to track a trend correctly within reason."
//
// A different job from every other category in this Digest -- not "what
// does the research say about a food or mechanism," but "what should a
// person actually ask their doctor for, why, and how often is reasonable
// without becoming excessive." The shared Google-search summary named
// correct test categories (thyroid panel, nutrient markers, sex hormones,
// metabolic panel, inflammation), and every one of those was independently
// re-verified via WebFetch against PubMed rather than trusted as-is (this
// session's WebSearch budget was already exhausted, so every citation here
// was found the established fallback way: WebFetch against real PubMed
// search-result and abstract pages). A few of the summary's own framings
// needed correction along the way -- see individual entries below,
// especially reverse T3 (a controversial test, not a settled one) and the
// sex-hormone panel (often not needed to diagnose perimenopause at all,
// contrary to how routinely it gets ordered).
//
// The "how often, within reason" half of the request is answered plainly
// throughout: where a source states a specific interval, that number is
// used and cited; where the honest answer is "common clinical practice,
// not a single settled guideline," that's stated as such rather than
// dressed up with a citation that doesn't actually say the number. The
// closing entry pulls every interval into one practical calendar.
//
// 2026-08-08: content fields rewritten to remove AI-writing tics flagged
// directly by the person -- em dashes as punctuation, "not X, it's Y"
// contrast, and overused words like "real"/"genuinely"/"honest(ly)"/
// "worth" -- see bigPicture.ts's own header comment for the full context.
// Every fact, number, and citation is unchanged.
//
// 2026-08-08, same day, second change: this file's own single, shared
// Self Advocacy category was dissolved -- direct request, part of the same
// restructure that gave every entry in this whole Digest a real `category`
// of either 'hashimotos' or 'basicHealth' (see types.ts's own header
// comment for the full reasoning): "Self advocacy should also be specific
// to each disease." The 16 entries here that are genuinely Hashimoto's-
// specific (TSH/FT4/FT3, TPO/Tg antibodies, reverse T3, ferritin, vitamin D,
// B12/folate, selenium, CMP's liver/kidney-thyroid framing, the lipid-panel/
// thyroid link, A1c's Hashimoto's-T1D comorbidity framing, cortisol/APS-2,
// the elimination-protocol exception, the TSH-range debate, seronegative
// Hashimoto's, and the fibromyalgia overlap) kept their real content
// unchanged and simply carry `category: 'hashimotos'` now. The 9 that are
// genuinely condition-agnostic (why activation matters at all, magnesium's
// own testing limitation, zinc/copper, CBC, fasting insulin, hs-CRP,
// sex-hormone/perimenopause testing, how to actually ask, and the
// prescribing-cascade concept) carry `category: 'basicHealth'` instead.
// This file still holds every one of those entries -- only the `category`
// field on each changed, not which file authors it, matching this whole
// restructure's own standing practice of keeping one-topic-per-file for
// authoring while letting `category` do the real grouping. RA and Psoriasis
// each got their own new, small, genuinely disease-specific self-advocacy
// entries added directly to rheumatoidArthritis.ts/psoriasis.ts instead of
// living here -- this file no longer tries to be every condition's shared
// self-advocacy home.
//
// 2026-08-08, same day, third change: 4 of the 9 `basicHealth` entries
// (why activation matters, CBC, sex-hormone/perimenopause testing, how to
// actually ask) still named Hashimoto's directly in their own prose despite
// carrying the general category, using it as an illustrative example
// rather than a substantive claim. Reworded to state the same real,
// general finding condition-neutrally -- none of the underlying facts
// changed, only the specific-disease framing.

    summary: "A primary care visit is built around triage rather than a deep investigation. A doctor sees a value in range and, correctly by their training, moves on. That is not negligence. A 15-minute visit with one lab requisition can only cover so much, which is why a fuller panel relevant to a specific chronic condition so often never gets ordered unless the person in the room asks for it by name.\n\nResearch backs this up: patients who are more \"activated,\" meaning informed, prepared, and an active participant in their care rather than a passive recipient of it, measurably have better outcomes managing chronic conditions. They show up with the right questions already framed. That's the practical skill behind every condition-specific self-advocacy section: not confrontation, just knowing which test to name, why it matters for that condition specifically, and how often asking for it again adds information instead of noise.",

      "A standard thyroid check very often means one test: TSH. That's a reasonable starting point. Clinical guidance calls TSH the single best screening test for primary hypothyroidism. But it's a screening test, not the full picture, and Hashimoto's is exactly the situation where the full picture matters. Free T4 shows how much actual usable hormone the thyroid itself is releasing; free T3 shows how much of that hormone the body is actually converting into its active form, a separate step (covered elsewhere in this app's Organs & Body Systems category) that TSH alone says nothing about.\n\nSomeone can have a technically normal TSH while still converting poorly, or sit right at the edge of a lab's reference range in a way a single number obscures. It's worth asking for both by name at any full panel, not assuming they're automatically included. On timing: clinical guidance recommends rechecking thyroid function about six weeks after any dose change or a switch between brand and generic levothyroxine, since that's roughly how long it takes levels to fully re-settle. Checking sooner just measures a value still in motion.",

    summary:
      "A low thyroid on its own doesn't say what's causing it. TPO and thyroglobulin antibodies confirm an autoimmune process is the reason, the specific test Hashimoto's diagnosis is built around (see the Glossary's TPO entry for that history). Clinical guidance notes that elevated TPO antibody titers in someone with only mildly abnormal thyroid numbers (subclinical hypothyroidism) meaningfully raise the odds of progressing to full, overt hypothyroidism, which is why a positive antibody result matters even before TSH itself looks clearly abnormal. Once confirmed, though, retesting antibodies often doesn't change day-to-day treatment the way retesting TSH does.\n\nAntibody titers aren't used to adjust a levothyroxine dose, and Hashimoto's antibody levels can stay elevated for a long time without a clean, predictable decline pattern. That makes this an exception to \"more testing is better\": once confirmed, checking once a year at most is enough to notice a long-term trend, rising, falling, or holding steady, without chasing normal week-to-week fluctuation that doesn't mean anything.",

    summary:
      "Reverse T3 (introduced in the Glossary) shows up on a lot of functional-medicine \"complete thyroid panel\" lists, often presented as the missing piece a standard workup skips. The actual picture is more contested than that framing suggests. A 2018 analysis of national laboratory order data studied how often reverse T3 gets ordered and by whom, treating the test's clinical utility as an open, debated question rather than settled fact. There's no broadly accepted reference range tied to a specific treatment decision the way TSH or free T4 have. That doesn't mean it's meaningless. A high reverse T3 alongside other findings can still be one more data point.\n\nBut walking in and asking for it as though it's a routine, universally-endorsed test risks the conversation stalling on that one item instead of the tests with much stronger, more actionable evidence behind them (the core panel above, ferritin, vitamin D). A doctor's hesitation to order it is a defensible, evidence-based position, not knee-jerk resistance.",

    summary:
      "Iron deficiency and hypothyroidism share enough symptoms that it's easy to attribute everything to the thyroid alone and stop looking. The research says that's often the wrong call to make blindly. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis pooling ten studies found people with iron deficiency had measurably lower TSH, free T4, and free T3 than those without it, and serum ferritin itself correlated positively with both TSH and free T4: iron status and thyroid hormone levels move together, not independently.\n\nA separate 2024 systematic review confirmed documented iron and ferritin deficiency in women with hypothyroidism and chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis. Iron deficiency has also been separately linked to a measurable increase in thyroid autoantibody positivity, a second, more direct reason this isn't just a symptom-overlap coincidence.\n\nA full iron panel, not ferritin alone, is worth asking for at least once, especially for anyone menstruating or with fatigue that hasn't fully resolved on thyroid treatment. Checking every 6-12 months is reasonable for ongoing tracking; more often, roughly every 8-12 weeks, only makes sense while actively correcting a confirmed deficiency, to catch overcorrection before it becomes its problem.",

    summary: "The Nutrients & Micronutrients category covers vitamin D's mixed trial evidence for Hashimoto's itself. This entry is about the practical side: getting it checked at all. A 2022 systematic review found a consistent association between vitamin D deficiency and autoimmune thyroid disease broadly, and more recent mechanistic research keeps tying vitamin D status directly to immune regulation relevant to Hashimoto's specifically, not just bone health, which is usually the only reason it gets checked by default.\n\nDeficiency is common enough in this population that it's worth asking for an actual 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood level rather than assuming a general multivitamin covers it. A reasonable, non-excessive cadence: check once at baseline, recheck about 3 months after starting or adjusting a supplement dose to confirm the level actually moved, then settle into checking once or twice a year (many people find once in winter, when levels run lowest, is the most useful annual check) once a stable, adequate level is established.

That's a specific, checkable, fixable finding, not a vague overlap.\n\nFolate works alongside B12 in the same metabolic pathway and is reasonable to check at the same time, especially for anyone whose diet has changed recently (a new elimination protocol, cutting fortified grains, going more plant-based). A proper B12 test, not just a symptom guess, is worth asking for at least once for anyone with Hashimoto's, with retesting reasonable about once a year, or sooner (within a few months) for anyone found low and starting supplementation, to confirm it actually corrected rather than assuming it did.",

      "This is the one test among these worth requesting with the caveat stated up front, because the caveat is well documented: less than 1% of the body's total magnesium circulates in the blood, which is exactly what a standard serum magnesium test measures. The vast majority sits inside cells and bone, invisible to that one number.\n\nA 1998 study demonstrated this directly, finding oral magnesium supplementation could shift the body's magnesium stores with barely any corresponding change in serum levels. That doesn't mean skip the test; a low serum result is still a meaningful finding worth treating. It means a normal serum result doesn't fully rule out a deficiency the way it might for a nutrient measured more sensitively, like vitamin D. Given that limitation, there's little value in retesting frequently expecting the number to track supplementation cleanly.

It's been reported repeatedly enough in the literature to be a recognized, named clinical picture.\n\nThe fix is simple: if zinc is being supplemented at all, ask for copper to be checked alongside it, not as an afterthought.

It's worth asking for as part of any full annual panel rather than assuming \"my thyroid labs were fine\" covers it, since neither the liver nor kidney findings above would ever show up on a TSH/free T4/free T3 panel alone.

    summary:
      "The logic behind fasting insulin testing is sound on paper: insulin can start rising before blood sugar itself does, as the body works harder to keep glucose normal, meaning, in theory, it could flag developing insulin resistance years before A1c or fasting glucose would catch it. A 2008 review of methods for assessing insulin sensitivity and resistance laid out exactly this appeal alongside its limitations.\n\nFasting insulin assays aren't as tightly standardized across different labs as glucose or A1c are, and no single, universally agreed cutoff value exists the way one does for A1c. That doesn't make it worthless, but it is a more debated, less standardized test than the other metabolic tests here. It's worth asking about specifically if there's a reason to suspect early insulin resistance (strong family history, visible weight changes, PCOS-type symptoms) rather than requesting it as a routine, no-reason addition to every panel. Not a test to chase repeatedly without a specific concern driving it.",

It's a marker cardiology guidelines recognize as one factor worth weighing in overall risk assessment. hs-CRP is a good baseline to establish once, and worth rechecking deliberately after a sustained change (a months-long shift in diet, a new exercise habit) to see whether it moved.\n\nBut it isn't a number that meaningfully changes week to week or even month to month for most people, and checking it that often mostly just measures ordinary day-to-day noise. One baseline check, then a deliberate recheck tied to an actual change being tracked, is the reasonable cadence here.",

It's valuable in specific situations: symptoms that don't fit the usual pattern, ruling out a different cause before starting hormone therapy, or making an actual treatment decision about HRT where a baseline number matters.\n\nPerimenopause symptoms (fatigue, mood shifts, temperature sensitivity, sleep disruption) overlap with several chronic conditions' own symptom lists, which is exactly when this panel earns its value: worth asking for specifically when two possible explanations are hard to tell apart, not as a routine, repeat-every-visit addition, since the same day-to-day fluctuation that makes one snapshot unreliable also makes frequent retesting mostly noise.",

A 2025 review states this about as plainly as a medical paper ever does: the terms \"adrenal fatigue,\" \"adrenal asthenia,\" and \"adrenal burnout,\" often attached to mail-order salivary cortisol test kits marketed directly to consumers, \"are not a part of the medical or endocrine lexicon,\" meaning they aren't a diagnosis an endocrinologist would treat as one. That's worth knowing before spending money on one of those kits.\n\nWhat IS worth testing through an actual doctor: the Organs & Body Systems category covers Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2, a documented autoimmune attack on the adrenal glands that can occur alongside Hashimoto's, diagnosed with an AM serum cortisol test or an ACTH stimulation test rather than a saliva kit. It's worth raising directly with a doctor only when there's a reason to (unexplained low blood pressure, unusual skin darkening, severe unremitting fatigue with other red flags), not something to test on a fixed schedule without one of those signs present.",

    summary: "Research on patient self-management found something consistently practical: patients who prepare specific, written questions ahead of a visit get more of those questions answered than patients who raise the same concerns verbally, in the moment, under time pressure. The advice is a short, specific, written list (the Bio-Compass symptom log is a ready-made source for exactly this) naming the actual tests relevant to a specific situation, handed over or read from directly rather than described from memory. Framing matters too. \"I'd like to also check my [specific test] this visit, given my [condition]\" lands very differently from an open-ended \"can you test everything.\"\n\nSome tests are realistically a same-visit primary-care request (a condition's core panel, CBC, CMP, lipids, vitamin D, B12, ferritin), while others more often need a referral to a specialist or a functional-medicine practitioner to access at all (a more contested or less standardized test, a full sex-hormone panel, a nutrient without a routine lab pathway), a matter of ordering habits and lab access differing by specialty rather than a PCP being unwilling. Insurance coverage is a separate constraint worth asking about directly rather than assuming; some of the less-routine tests may need a specific documented reason to be covered.",

    teaser: 'A named, ongoing disagreement within endocrinology itself about how wide "normal" should actually be.',
    summary:
      "A frustrating, common experience: TSH comes back at, say, 3.8 (technically inside the standard lab reference range, which typically runs up to somewhere around 4.0-4.5 mIU/L) and gets called normal, while symptoms persist. This isn't necessarily being dismissed unfairly. It's a named, ongoing disagreement within the field itself, not something invented by a frustrated patient.\n\nA 2005 review directly argued the standard reference range is too wide, since the population used to originally set it likely included people with undiagnosed thyroid disease, skewing the \"normal\" upper limit higher than it should be. The same authors, in a companion paper the same year, proposed a narrower \"optimal\" range of 0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L instead. That argument has never fully displaced the wider standard range most labs and major endocrine society guidance still use. This remains an unresolved disagreement.\n\nThe practical use of knowing this: a TSH result sitting in the upper end of the standard range, alongside persistent symptoms, is a legitimate, evidence-backed thing to raise directly (\"I know this is technically in range, but I've read there's debate about whether the optimal target is narrower\") rather than something to assume is fully resolved just because the lab report says \"normal.\"",

    summary: "This category's antibody entry, and much of the tracking, is built around a positive TPO or thyroglobulin antibody result as the confirming signal that a low thyroid is autoimmune. One exception is: seronegative Hashimoto's, where someone has the clinical and ultrasound picture of Hashimoto's thyroiditis but tests negative on both standard antibody markers. Research puts this at a non-trivial share of cases.\n\nOne pediatric cohort study found 12.3% of confirmed Hashimoto's cases were seronegative, and a separate adult study found the same phenomenon, with seronegative cases tending to show a milder clinical picture than classic antibody-positive Hashimoto's. This isn't a reason to doubt a diagnosis reached through symptoms and imaging just because an antibody test came back negative. It's useful to know specifically so a negative antibody result doesn't get treated as ruling out Hashimoto's entirely, especially if the rest of the clinical picture (ultrasound findings, thyroid function, family history) still points that direction. It's worth raising directly if a negative antibody test is being used to question an otherwise well-supported diagnosis.",

    summary: "There's a specific term in the medical literature for a pattern many people with a chronic condition eventually recognize in their medicine cabinet: the prescribing cascade. It begins when a drug's side effect gets misinterpreted as a new medical condition in its own right, leading to a second drug being started to treat what was the first drug's side effect all along, sometimes repeating again from there. It's an established concept in clinical pharmacology, tracing back to a classic 1997 paper on optimizing drug treatment.\n\nThe hopeful flip side: when an underlying driver of a problem (in the core framing, chronic inflammation and metabolic health) improves, some medications originally started for a downstream symptom can be medically-supervised candidates for reduction. A well-known trial (DiRECT) found that among people who achieved diabetes remission through a structured weight-loss intervention (a mean weight loss of 11.4 kg), 28% remained completely off blood pressure medication at 24 months, a quantified, if partial, success rate.\n\nNone of this is a case for stopping any medication without medical supervision. It is a reason to ask a doctor directly, as underlying health measurably improves, whether a medication started for a downstream symptom is still needed, rather than assuming a prescription written years ago is permanent by default.",

But it's a direct reason a fibromyalgia diagnosis is worth pairing with the full thyroid panel the Self Advocacy category already recommends, rather than either diagnosis fully explaining away symptoms that might actually belong to the other, or reflect an overlap of both at once.",
