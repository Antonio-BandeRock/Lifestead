// A real, reusable microphone button, built 2026-08-16 -- one shared
// component embedded next to every real search box in the app, and next
// to every genuine free-text notes field, rather than each screen wiring
// up its own copy of expo-speech-recognition. See
// hooks/useVoiceDictation.ts for the actual native wrapper this sits on.
//
// Two real, distinct usage shapes, both going through the same one
// onResult callback -- the caller decides which one it needs, this
// component doesn't guess:
//   - A search box wants every result (partial included) to replace its
//     query text live, the same "search as you speak" feel a phone's own
//     voice search already has -- call onResult with every (transcript,
//     isFinal) pair and just set your query state to transcript each
//     time.
//   - A notes/dictation field wants the FINAL transcript only, run
//     through lib/voiceCommandParsing.ts's real command parser and
//     appended to whatever's already there -- ignore isFinal === false
//     calls entirely and only act once isFinal is true.
