// A real, one-time loading screen -- 2026-08-10, direct request after
// confirming what a 30-60 second blank-looking Home page on first launch
// actually was: lib/db.ts's own getReferenceDatabase() copies the app's
// entire bundled, scored, 22,000+-food reference database onto the
// device's own writable storage the first time anything actually needs
// it (expo-sqlite's importDatabaseFromAssetAsync), a real, one-time file
// operation big enough to take real, noticeable time on a phone. Confirmed
// directly this happens on every genuinely fresh install, not just a dev
// artifact -- a new customer's first launch has no record of ever having
// imported this database, so this same screen is exactly what they'd see.
//
// A real, honest constraint shapes the percentage shown: expo-sqlite's
// importDatabaseFromAssetAsync is a single opaque Promise with no
// byte-level progress callback anywhere in its own API -- there is no
// real number to read "43% copied" from. The percentage climbing below is
// a disclosed ESTIMATE, calibrated (not guessed) against this app's own
// directly reported real-world timing (roughly 30-60 seconds) -- but the
// one thing it never does is claim done before it's true.
//
// A real, direct follow-up the same day tried a CATCH-UP animation instead
// of jumping straight to 100 the instant isComplete fires -- a real, short,
// elapsed-time-driven tween from wherever the estimate happened to be
// sitting, so the finish never read as an arbitrary snap. Removed again,
// 2026-08-11, direct instruction: "Remove that" -- the manufactured "still
// doing something" animation for the last stretch was itself the problem,
// not the snap it was built to avoid. Back to the simpler, honest behavior:
// `isComplete` jumps `percent` straight to a true 100 and moves to
// 'finished' immediately, no animated close.
//
// 2026-08-16, a real, direct correction: "That was put in place to hide
// the loading time of the home screen on the first load of the app
// starting... It has not changed a bit since I reported it." Confirmed by
// reading app/_layout.tsx directly -- `isComplete` had only ever reflected
// the reference-database import, with zero connection to Home's own,
// separate, un-gated load underneath it. `isComplete` now means "the WHOLE
// combined startup wait is genuinely over" (see app/_layout.tsx's own
// wiring), not just the reference-database half of it. This screen's own
// container is now a real, absolutely-positioned, high-elevation overlay
// (not just a flex:1 box) so it can render ON TOP of the real app --
// mounted underneath it the moment the reference-database import itself
// resolves, so Home can start its own real load immediately, while this
// stays visible over it until Home genuinely finishes too. Nothing about
// the actual percent/phase logic below changed -- only what real event
// `isComplete` is now allowed to represent.
