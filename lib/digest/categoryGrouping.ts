// single Earth Matters entry, since every one of them lives in
// foodIndustryHistory.ts and carries the literal substring "history" in
// its own id prefix (foodhistory-... or foodhistory-regen-...) -- an
// unrelated file-naming coincidence, not a real topical match. That one
// check alone silently swallowed the entire category before any later,
// more specific branch (Diet & Food, etc.) ever got a chance to run, which
// is why only "History & Milestones" (everything) plus the always-separate
// "Putting It Together" closing card ever showed up. Home Gardening never

// "history"), but it was still routed through the identical
// disease-oriented classifier, whose keyword nets (Medications & Treatment,
// Self-Advocacy & Testing, Whole-Body Effects, etc.) mean nothing for

//
// Both classifiers below are built as an explicit, verified id-substring
// lookup, not a fresh attempt at a broad keyword net -- every one of the

// via a throwaway script before this shipped (the same "verify against
// real data first" discipline this whole Digest has used throughout),
// confirming 100% real coverage with zero entries falling through
// unmatched and zero double-matches, rather than trusting that the
