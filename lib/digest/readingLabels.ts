// Reading Nutrition Labels & Ingredient Lists -- new 2026-08-09, a direct,
// deliberate companion to Choosing the Real Thing (product quality/
// mislabeling): that topic covers whether a product IS what it claims to
// be; this one covers how to actually read the label once you're holding a
// genuine product, the real regulatory mechanics behind the Nutrition
// Facts panel and ingredient list that most people have never had
// explained. Every claim independently verified via WebSearch before being
// written in, the same discipline as every other category in this Digest.

    teaser: 'Every number and every ingredient on a US food label follows a specific federal rule. Knowing the rule is what makes the label readable.',
    summary:
      "The Nutrition Facts panel and ingredient list on a packaged food sold in the US are both governed by specific FDA regulations, not a manufacturer's free choice of what to show or how to show it.\n\nThat structure is exactly what makes a label decodable once the underlying rules are known: the ingredient list always follows one fixed ordering rule, the Daily Value percentages are always calculated the same way regardless of the product, and specific allergens must always be disclosed in one of two specific formats. These entries cover those mechanics directly, so a label reads as information rather than marketing.",

    teaser: 'The percentage next to each nutrient on a label always means the same thing: how much of a fixed daily reference amount one serving supplies, 5% or less is low, 20% or more is high.',
    summary: "The % Daily Value (%DV) shown for each nutrient is calculated the same way every time: the nutrient amount in one serving divided by the FDA's fixed Daily Value reference amount for that nutrient, times 100. That reference amount is built around a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, chosen by the FDA as a reasonable approximation of an average adult's energy need, not a personal target, and not adjusted for an individual's calorie need the way the DRI-percentage tracking in Insights is.\n\nA simple rule of thumb the FDA itself states directly: 5% DV or less is considered low for a nutrient, 20% DV or higher is considered high, useful for a fast read of any label, regardless of which specific nutrient it's attached to.",

    teaser: 'The first ingredient on any US food label is always the one that weighs the most in the actual product, a fixed rule for reading any label.',
    summary:
      "Federal regulation requires every ingredient on a US food label to be listed by its common name in descending order of predominance by weight, the heaviest ingredient in the product always comes first, the lightest always comes last, with no exception for how a manufacturer might prefer the list to read. This is a useful, fast way to read any product: if sugar (in any of its names) appears in the first two or three ingredients, sugar makes up a meaningful share of that product's actual weight.\n\nThe one exception: ingredients present at 2% or less of the product's total weight can be grouped at the end of the list, following a phrase like \"contains 2% or less of,\" without needing to follow strict descending order among themselves, a legitimate reason a small-quantity spice or preservative might not appear in exact weight order relative to its neighbors.",

    teaser: 'A manufacturer can add several different named sugars, each in a small enough amount to avoid the top of the ingredient list, while the total added sugar still adds up to a meaningful amount.',
    summary:
      "Documented tracking of ingredient labels has found over 56 different names sugar can legally appear under, dextrose, sucrose, fructose, maltodextrin, cane juice, brown rice syrup, and dozens more, each a chemically distinct or differently-sourced sugar, not a synonym invented to deceive on its own.\n\nThe worth-knowing consequence is a documented practice: a manufacturer can add several of these different named sugars to a product, each individually small enough to sit lower on the ingredient list than a single combined \"sugar\" entry would, while the product's total added sugar content stays the same or higher. The one number that cuts through this reliably is the \"Added Sugars\" line on the Nutrition Facts panel itself, which reports the combined total regardless of how many different names appear in the ingredient list above it.",

    teaser: 'The same product can display very different-looking numbers depending only on how large a "serving" the manufacturer defines it as.',
    summary: "Every number on a Nutrition Facts panel, calories, sugar, sodium, everything, is reported per the manufacturer's declared serving size, not per package. A smaller declared serving size makes every one of those numbers look smaller on the label, without the product itself changing at all: the same bag of chips can show a lower sugar or sodium figure simply by declaring a smaller official serving than most people would eat in one sitting.\n\nThe Portions & Recommended Amounts research covers the separate finding that larger portions increase how much people eat; this is the related, label-reading half of that same problem: the number on the package and the amount a person consumes are frequently two different quantities, and only checking servings-per-container against how much is eaten reconciles them.",

    teaser: 'Milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy, and (as of 2023) sesame all have to be named by their plain source, even inside an ingredient that sounds unrelated.',
    summary:
      "US federal law requires nine specific major allergens (milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybean, and, since January 1, 2023 under the FASTER Act, sesame) to be disclosed in one of two specific formats: named directly in parentheses right after an ingredient that doesn't obviously reveal it (\"natural flavor (sesame)\"), or grouped together in a plain \"Contains\" statement immediately after the ingredient list.\n\nSesame's 2023 addition is a recent example of how the allergen list itself can change, it took an act of Congress (the FASTER Act, signed 2021) specifically because sesame allergy reactions were not being reliably caught under the eight-allergen list that existed before it. This mechanism exists for exactly the situation an unfamiliar-sounding ingredient name creates: an allergen hiding inside a name that gives no obvious clue on its own.",

    title: 'Three Rules Cover Most of What a Label Says',
    teaser: 'Ingredient order reflects weight, %DV reflects a fixed 2,000-calorie reference, and serving size is the manufacturer\'s choice, knowing these three rules makes almost any label readable.',
    summary:
      "Across every label, three fixed rules do most of the work of reading a label correctly: ingredients are always listed by descending weight (so the first few names matter most), %DV is always calculated against the same fixed 2,000-calorie reference regardless of the product (so 5%/20% is a portable rule of thumb), and serving size is the one number in this whole system a manufacturer gets to define, which is exactly why it deserves its separate check against how much a person eats.\n\nNone of this requires special training or a nutrition degree, it requires knowing these three fixed rules exist, and reading the label with them in mind rather than trusting the front-of-package marketing to tell the same story.",
