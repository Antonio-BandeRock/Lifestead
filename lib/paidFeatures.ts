// Which lenses sit behind payment, P27 (1.0.65.x, 2026-10-09). Direct
// request: "a free to paid switch in developer tools that puts the paid
// things behind a virtual wall so I am able to use the app in free mode to
// see what the user would see."
//
// The authority is the free/paid board
// (https://claude.ai/artifact/U9AUm2LG8f6dzrWmHPDJCt): every lens below is a
// function the board's tilted line, or a pin on it, puts on the paid side,
// read on 2026-10-09 with the split at left 3.6, right 2.05. When the board
// moves, this table moves with it; nothing else in the app decides.
//
// Three things never enter this table, checked by scripts/test_paid_features.js:
// safety (P28: the emergency card, My Meds and its interactions, the timing
// warnings, allergy cautions), what safety reads (the med list, dose
// reminders), and privacy (App Lock and the vault, by decision U4).
//
// Pure data and pure functions, no React and no Expo, so the test runs in
// plain Node. The setting itself lives in lib/entitlement.ts.
