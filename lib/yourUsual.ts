// "Your usual range" on Trends (Phase B of the 2026-09-24 gap review,
// item 14). Pure: no imports, no I/O.
//
// A latest reading means more beside the person's earlier readings than
// on its own, so weight, steps, sleep and lab results say whether the
// latest one sits inside the middle of what came before, below it, or
// above it. The range is the 10th to the 90th percentile of the earlier
// readings, and needs at least MIN_USUAL_READINGS of them.
//
// Worded with the same limits as Growing Conditions: usual is what this
// person's readings have been, never what they should be. Nothing here
// says abnormal, too high, too low, ideal, optimal or healthy, and
// scripts/test_phase_b_patterns.js sweeps for those words. A lab's
// reference range is a separate thing, printed by the lab, and stays
// where it already is.
