// The one folder somebody chooses, and the shape the app keeps inside it.
//
// THE CORRECTION THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. An earlier pass asked for two folders to
// be chosen separately, one for the mailbox and one for backups, which put the
// person in charge of a layout the app should be keeping itself. The right shape
// was stated plainly: one Shared Folder, made when the app is first opened
// whether or not anybody is ever added as a partner, with everything the app
// keeps in OneDrive living under it.
//
//   Shared Folder            what the person picks, once
//   |- Mailbox               where every person's mailbox lives
//   |- Backups               where backups are written
//   |- Photos                every photo, encrypted, one file each
//   |- Recordings            audio somebody brought in, one file each
//   |- Videos                held for video, made only when the first is kept
//
// EACH KIND OF FILE HAS A FOLDER OF ITS OWN (2026-09-30, by direct
// instruction: "keep each file type grouped accordingly"). The shared
// folder is where photos and recordings live; a device keeps thumbnails and
// a cache of what was opened lately (lib/media.ts), so neither device fills
// up. Photos sat inside Backups before 1.0.57.23, and a pass moves them.
//
// MAILBOX IS A CONTAINER FOR EVERYBODY'S MAIL, not one person's inbox. Files in
// it are already named for who they are addressed to and who they came from, so
// a partner and, later, a child all use the same folder without seeing each
// other's mail: lib/syncInbox.ts's own incomingFilesFor drops anything not
// addressed to this device before a byte is downloaded.
//
// BACKUPS SITS UNDER THE SHARED FOLDER TOO, by direct decision. That has a
// consequence worth being straight about rather than burying: whoever the Shared
// Folder is shared with in OneDrive can see the Backups folder inside it, and a
// backup is the whole record. The app says so on the screen where the folder is
// chosen rather than leaving somebody to work it out.
//
// LOOKED UP BY NAME, NOT REMEMBERED BY ID. Somebody can delete or recreate
// either child in OneDrive, and an id remembered from months ago would point at
// nothing while the folder they can plainly see sits there unused.
//
// ONE FOLDER, CHOSEN ON EITHER KIND OF DEVICE. A phone stores the folder's
// Graph address; a computer stores its path on the disk (driveId 'disk',
// lib/desktop/cloudFolder.ts). A backup restored across the two carries the
// other kind's address, so getSharedFolder reads the stored folder's path
// sentence ("OneDrive / Apps / Lifestead") back into a folder on this
// computer when it can, and says plainly where the folder was chosen when it
// cannot, rather than reporting a Graph error about an id that means nothing
// here or a disk path that means nothing on a phone.
