// The relay: a mailbox on the Internet that cannot read its own mail.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every carrier before this one needed the two people to
// arrange something. A file needs somebody to send it and somebody to open it.
// Sync over Wi-Fi needs both phones in the same place at the same time. The
// OneDrive mailbox needs a Microsoft account on both ends and a folder shared
// between them. All three work, and none of them work when one person is at
// the shops and the other is at home wondering what is for dinner.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES. It holds a sealed blob addressed to a key fingerprint until
// the holder of that key comes and collects it. That is the whole service.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY CANNOT DO. It cannot read anything it holds. The payload
// is sealed to the recipient's X25519 key by lib/partnerCrypto.ts on the
// sending phone, so what arrives here is ciphertext and what leaves here is the
// same ciphertext. There is no key here that could open it and no way to add
// one later without changing the app on both phones. This is the first server
// in the path of this app's health data, and that property is the entire reason
// it was acceptable to put one there.
//
// WHAT IT KNOWS, STATED HONESTLY. It knows that a device with fingerprint A put
// something addressed to fingerprint B, how big it was and when. It does not
// know who A or B are, what conditions either person has, or what is in the
// payload. That is a social graph of anonymous 16-character addresses. It is not
// nothing, and it is written down here rather than glossed over.
//
// HOW IT KNOWS WHO IS ASKING, WITHOUT A ROSTER. There are no accounts here. A
// mailbox address IS a key fingerprint, and the way to prove you own a mailbox
// is to sign a fresh challenge with the key that fingerprint came from. The
// Worker hashes the public key it was handed, checks that hash is the mailbox
// being asked for, and checks the signature. Holding the private key is the only
// credential, which means there is nothing here to steal, reset, or leak, and no
// password for anyone to forget.
//
// WHY THAT CHECK IS NOT WHAT KEEPS THE MAIL PRIVATE. The signature stops mail
// being deleted or a mailbox being flooded. It is not what stops mail being
// read: the sealing already did that. If this check were bypassed entirely
// tomorrow, an attacker would be holding ciphertext they cannot open. Depth,
// not the wall.
//
// WAKING THE OTHER PHONE (M1, 1.0.62.2). Mail that sits here until somebody
// opens the app is only half a carrier. A phone that holds a mailbox can leave
// its Firebase Cloud Messaging address here (the register verb, signed with the
// mailbox's key like everything else), and when mail is put in that mailbox
// this Worker asks Google to wake that phone. The wake-up says one thing, that
// mail is waiting, with no sender, no size and nothing from the body. The phone
// then collects it the ordinary signed way. What this adds to what the relay
// knows: that a fingerprint belongs to an Android phone Google can reach.
//
// The Firebase key lives only as the Worker secret FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT, never
// in this repository. Without it, mail is still held and collected; nothing
// wakes, and the phone finds it the next time the app is opened.
//
// See lib/relayProtocol.ts in the app for the canonical signed-message format
// this file has to agree with byte for byte.
