    title: "Selenium Lowered TPO Antibodies Across 21 Randomized Trials, With One Caveat",
    teaser: 'Out of every supplement researched here, one stands clearly above the rest in trial-level evidence, with one caveat.',
    summary: "If someone with Hashimoto's asked which single supplement has the most trial evidence behind it, out of everything covered anywhere, the answer is selenium, and it isn't particularly close. A systematic meta-analysis of 21 randomized controlled trials, 1,610 subjects combined, found selenium supplementation measurably reduces TPO antibody levels over 3-6 months, the strongest trial-level evidence behind any Hashimoto's-specific supplement claim researched anywhere here.\n\nA separate Cochrane Library review of the same general evidence base (a smaller slice, 4 studies, 463 participants) rated it unclear-to-high risk of bias and concluded the evidence was \"incomplete and not reliable to help inform clinical decision making.\" That's not a contradiction. Cochrane's methodology is deliberately stricter about bias risk than a typical meta-analysis. But it's a reason to hold this tier a notch more provisionally than the larger meta-analysis alone would suggest. Still the strongest single finding in this entire research base, and still worth an asterisk rather than an unqualified endorsement.",

A 2024 update to the evidence found a way to make it stronger still.\n\nAn updated meta-analysis found that myo-inositol, combined with selenium, outperforms selenium supplementation by itself for reducing TPO antibody levels, a new supplement candidate the research surfaced beyond what was already established for selenium alone, and specifically studied as a combination, not myo-inositol taken on its own. This is alongside selenium itself rather than a replacement for it, and the trials tested the pairing, not myo-inositol as an independent supplement.",

    summary:
      "Most of the nutrients in this category follow a familiar shape: not enough is a problem, and getting to \"enough\" solves it. Iodine is the exception, and it's worth understanding exactly why. Iodine is required for thyroid hormone synthesis, so deficiency is a well-established cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, the more familiar half of the story.\n\nBut excess iodine intake, particularly a rapid increase from a previously deficient baseline, is separately documented as a trigger for autoimmune thyroiditis in genetically susceptible people. That makes iodine a two-edged case where \"more is better\" simply doesn't hold, unlike most of the other nutrients in this category. A practical reason to track actual intake rather than supplement broadly on the assumption that more of a needed nutrient can only help. See Problem Foods & Swaps for exactly where that assumption goes wrong in practice, with kelp and other iodine-heavy sea vegetables.",

The evidence is split, not one-sided. A positive meta-analysis links higher vitamin D status to lower TPO antibody levels, while a separate, placebo-controlled randomized trial found no significant effect of supplementation on thyroid autoimmunity markers. That pattern, a consistent correlation alongside unreliable intervention trials, doesn't stop at Hashimoto's. It shows up independently in rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis too, confirmed three separate times across three different diseases studied by three different research groups with no reason to influence each other's results.\n\nThe research names it as one biological uncertainty, confirmed three separate times rather than once. Not a reason to dismiss vitamin D, but a reason not to treat it as a settled, guaranteed fix either.

    summary:
      "Someone with Hashimoto's feeling exhausted, noticing their hair thinning, struggling to think clearly, has every reason to assume it's the thyroid. Sometimes it is. Often, it's more complicated than that. Zinc, iron, and B12 deficiency are all independently common in Hashimoto's patients, and each one can independently cause fatigue, hair thinning, and cognitive symptoms that overlap heavily with thyroid symptoms themselves.\n\nA deficiency in any of these three can be mistaken for, or can quietly compound, undertreated thyroid disease. Iron deficiency specifically goes one step further: it directly impairs thyroid peroxidase activity, a mechanistic interaction, not just a coincidental symptom overlap. This is worth bloodwork rather than assuming every symptom traces back to the same single cause. Three separate, checkable possibilities hiding behind what can look like one familiar complaint.",

    summary: "Nigella sativa (black seed) already earned its entry for trial evidence, but it isn't the herbal supplement most commonly discussed in Hashimoto's patient communities. That title belongs to ashwagandha, an adaptogenic herb used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries, and it has trial evidence behind it too, if still limited. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 50 subclinical hypothyroid patients (46 completed) found 8 weeks of 600mg daily ashwagandha root extract significantly improved TSH, T3, and T4 compared to placebo, a measured effect, not just a traditional-use claim. Because of how it works, as a thyroid-hormone-raising herb, it carries a mechanistic reason for caution in anyone already hyperthyroid or being treated for Graves' disease, not just Hashimoto's.\n\nAdding a hormone-raising supplement on top of a condition that already has too much thyroid hormone is an avoidable risk, not a theoretical one. Worth discussing with a doctor before starting, the same standing advice already given for every supplement candidate, especially given this evidence is still just one trial deep, not the multi-study depth selenium's entry has.",

    summary: "The iodine entry above already makes the case that iodine is an exception to \"more is better.\"\n\nExcess intake, especially a sudden increase from a lower baseline, is a documented trigger for autoimmune thyroid flares in genetically susceptible people, and Problem Foods & Swaps covers exactly how that plays out with kelp and other iodine-heavy sea vegetables. The same mechanism applies at least as strongly, arguably more, to a different and easy-to-overlook source: standalone potassium iodide or iodine supplement pills, often marketed directly as \"thyroid support\" to the exact population, people with a diagnosed thyroid condition, most at risk of the excess-iodine trigger the research already documents.\n\nA supplement pill makes it far easier to take a large, concentrated, precisely-repeatable dose than eating kelp ever would, which makes it a higher-risk exposure route for the identical underlying mechanism, not a separate concern needing its new evidence base. A \"thyroid support\" label on a supplement bottle is not, on its own, a reason to trust it's safe for a Hashimoto's-specific iodine level.

Selenium, paired with myo-inositol, carries the strongest trial-level evidence of anything in the entire research base, with iodine's two-edged deficiency/excess risk close behind as similarly well-established, a risk that applies whether the source is food, kelp, or a supplement pill, not three separate concerns. Vitamin D, zinc/iron/B12, Nigella sativa, and ashwagandha sit in a middle tier: mechanisms and trial data, but each still resting on fewer, smaller trials than selenium's much deeper evidence base. Folate and the antioxidant vitamins sit at the bottom: findings, but thin and mostly observational. None of this is a reason to ignore the weaker entries. It's a reason to prioritize selenium and iodine status first if choosing where to actually start, and to treat everything below that as worth a conversation with a doctor rather than aggressive self-supplementing based on a correlation alone.",
