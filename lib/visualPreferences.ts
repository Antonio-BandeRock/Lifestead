// Visual preferences -- 2026-08-08, explicitly requested as a Profile-area
// preference: the ability to turn off the shared flowery background, to
// turn off or swap each individual tab's own background image independently
// rather than all-or-nothing, and to pick a calmer, generic alternative (a
// few color combinations) instead of the photo. Framed directly by the
// person as "for the few men who would have this app and have a problem
// with all the colors and flowers."
//
// 2026-08-17: the animated sky overlay (sun/moon/stars, day/night tint) is
// removed entirely, not just toggleable -- reported as real, confirmed
// battery drain (a continuously-running animation, on top of a separate,
// bigger, real cause found the same day: see constants/colors.ts's own
// header note on the app's whole iridescent header/footer/ring system,
// which is also removed for the identical reason). skyAnimationsEnabled is
// gone from this type as a direct result -- there's nothing left to toggle.
// genericPalette below now does double duty: the same 12 combinations that
// already stood in for the photo background now also drive the app's
// header/footer text and lines and TabHub's popup card border, statically
// (see GenericBackground.tsx's own header comment).
//
// Stored the same way getStoredMeasurementSystem already does (lib/db.ts) --
// a single JSON blob under one `app_meta` key, not a dedicated table, since
// this is one small, cohesive settings object rather than several
// independently-queried fields. Kept in its own file rather than folded into
// the already-7,000-line lib/db.ts.
//
// Live-reactive across the app via a tiny module-level cache + subscriber
// list (see subscribeToVisualPreferences/useVisualPreferences below) --
// needed because the shared background lives in app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx,
// mounted once, permanently, above every tab, so a toggle flipped on the
// Profile screen has to reach it without a full app restart.

// changes the color of the profile header and only after I restart the
// app"). Root cause, confirmed by that exact symptom -- expo-router's
// file-based routing requires every screen file to build its route table,
// which runs every one of their module-scope StyleSheet.create() calls
// (each baking in whatever constants/colors.ts's `colors.background` etc.
// already were) before RootLayout's own effects ever get a chance to fire.
// By the time the old async applyGroundTheme() call ran, it was already too
// late for anything but a JSX value read at render time (which is exactly
// why only the header, which reads colors.background directly rather than
// through a pre-built StyleSheet object, ever picked up the change).
//
// The only ordering that's actually early enough is inside
// constants/colors.ts's own module-top-level code, before it exports

// has to be a synchronous read.

// 2026-08-27, rebuilt from scratch, not patched a third time: the

// connection to the same file getDatabase() already holds asynchronously
// (assumed safe -- "SQLite supports multiple connections to one file by
// design"), and that assumption turned out wrong in practice, twice.
// 2026-08-19's own version left the sync connection open, which broke
// getDatabase()'s own async open moments later ("NativeDatabase.
// prepareAsync... NullPointerException"); fixed by closing the sync
// connection immediately. 2026-08-27 morning, closing immediately turned
// out to only narrow the same race, not close it -- a slow reference-db
// reimport shifted timing enough to reopen it, this time surfacing as
// "NativeStatement.finalizeAsync... Cannot use shared object that was
// already released," an unhandled promise rejection from deep inside
// expo-sqlite's own native bridge, with no app code anywhere in its own
// call stack to retry from. Direct follow-up the same day, right after
// that first patch shipped: the exact same symptom, still happening.
// Two SQLite connections (sync and async) to the same file evidently
// share more native state under the hood than expo-sqlite's own public
// API promises -- not something fixable from this app's JS layer by
// reordering opens and closes a third time.
//
// The real fix: stop opening a second SQLite connection here at all.

// getVisualPreferences() runs its own real load a few moments later and
// writes the mirror for every launch after. A real, visible, but minor
