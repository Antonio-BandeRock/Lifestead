  // item in a band bottom-aligns regardless of its own font size or
  // control height.
  // Servings/Size/Units all use this -- see the JSX comment above them for
  // why three equal flex columns replaced two fixed widths plus a
  // remainder.
  // sizeLabelRow / scrollHint / sizeInputGroup / amountPicker lived here
  // until 2026-07-31 -- they laid out the per-ingredient Quantity and
  // Units pickers side by side under a shared label row. That whole shape
  // was replaced by four stacked, individually-labeled fields
  // (renderLabeledPicker), leaving these with no callers, so they were
  // removed rather than left as dead styles.

  // The unit/amount pills sit inline beside their own sibling (unit next
  // to the amount picker, or Servings alone in its own row), 2026-07-28,
  // as a scrollable box (vertical since 2026-07-29, see renderPillPicker's
  // own comment) so every option stays reachable without needing to grow
  // wider. Bordered -- a plain unbounded
  // ScrollView butted right up against its sibling had nothing marking
  // where one ends and the other begins. Same colors.border/borderRadius
  // recipe as formInput's own outline (below), so this reads as matching
  // form chrome. Background is applied inline at the render site instead
  // of here, matching every input's own backgroundColor -- both need the
  // live tabColor prop to compute (inputBackground(tabColor)), which a
  // static StyleSheet object has no access to.
  //
  // Deliberately has no width/flex of its own -- renderPillPicker always
  // pairs this with EITHER a fixed-width style (servingsPicker/
  // amountPicker) OR pillScrollFlex below, never both at once (flex: 1
  // implies flexBasis: 0%, which would silently win over an explicit
  // width set alongside it, undoing the fixed width entirely).
  // The ScrollView inside spans this box's FULL size, 2026-07-28 (see
  // renderPillPicker's own "fourth pass" comment for why) -- the two
  // scrollArrowBadge indicators are an absolute overlay on top of it, not
  // separate flex siblings, so a drag starting anywhere in this box,
  // including visually on top of a badge, still reaches the ScrollView
  // underneath and scrolls it. overflow: 'hidden' keeps the ScrollView's
  // own content clipped to this box's rounded corners, same reasoning as
  // InlineSelectList.tsx's own container.
  //
  // height added 2026-07-29 (the fifth-pass switch to vertical scrolling,
  // see renderPillPicker's own comment) -- a ScrollView needs a bounded
  // cross-axis size to actually scroll rather than just growing to fit
  // its content; the old horizontal version got this for free from the
  // row's own width, but a vertical one needs it stated explicitly.
  // Picked to comfortably show about two pills at rest with a clear peek
  // of a third -- enough to read as "a short scrollable list," not so
  // tall it dominates the Servings/Size/Units row it sits in. Tune
  // on-device if it reads too cramped or too tall in practice.
  // The unit picker's own sizing -- fills exactly whatever width its row
  // has left after its sibling's own fixed width (Servings, or the amount
  // picker beside it); height now comes from pillScroll's own fixed
  // height above regardless of how much content there is to scroll.
  // paddingVertical widened 2026-07-29 (was paddingHorizontal, back when
  // this scrolled sideways -- see renderPillPicker's own "fifth pass"
  // comment) so a real pill never scrolls in directly underneath either
  // scrollArrowBadge (a 16px badge inset 2px from the top/bottom edge
  // reaches ~18px in) -- the same reasoning as before, just rotated 90
  // degrees along with the scroll axis. paddingHorizontal shrunk back
  // down since there's no longer a left/right badge to clear.
  // pillRow / pill lived here until 2026-07-31 -- the wrapping chip grid

  // The only pill style left, used inside every scrollable pill picker
  // (renderPillPicker). Its shorter paddingVertical (4, vs the 6 the old

  // textAlign matters now that renderLabeledPicker stretches every pill to
