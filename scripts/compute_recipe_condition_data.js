// Computes, for all 300 curated recipes, real condition-safety and
// healing-stage data -- 2026-08-24, direct request: "there needs to be
// an association between the recipes and the conditions somehow, so
// that the user can look through their specific condition that will
// then show them meals they can eat, depending on the stage of their
// conditions."
//
// Everything here reuses this app's own already-built, already-verified
// condition-scoring and stage-advisory machinery, faithfully replicated
// against the live database via raw SQL rather than re-derived or
// guessed -- the exact same queries/rules lib/db.ts's own
// getFoodScoresForCondition/getFoodScores and the six per-condition
// stage-advisory files (lib/healingStageAdvisory.ts,
// lib/ibsPhaseAdvisory.ts, lib/celiacStageAdvisory.ts,
// lib/ibdStageAdvisory.ts, lib/ckdStageAdvisory.ts,
// lib/goutStageAdvisory.ts) already use in the running app, so a recipe
// tagged "safe" here means the exact same thing "no flag" already means
// everywhere else in this app.
//
// Three real, separate outputs per recipe:
//
//   safeForConditions: string[] -- condition codes (the live
//     `conditions` table's own snake_case codes) this recipe has ZERO
//     flagged (yellow/red-tier) ingredients for, scoped to that
//     condition's own real relevant sub-criteria (home_condition_code
//     OR sub_criterion_condition_relevance), exactly matching
//     getFoodScoresForCondition's own real scoping. Only computed for
//     conditions with real, non-empty scoring coverage in this
//     database. Migraine had ZERO home-owned or relevance-mapped
//     sub-criteria when this script was first written (2026-08-24),
//     excluded rather than trivially marked "safe" for everything --
//     later the same day, direct follow-up research (see
//     migraine-aip-elimination-diet-inflammation/-histamine-dao-
//     deficiency in lib/digest/migraine.ts) justified a real
//     Additives/Processing relevance mapping (see
//     scripts/add_migraine_condition_relevance.js), so Migraine now has
//     real coverage too -- all 19 tracked conditions do.
//
//   conditionCautions: {[conditionCode]: {severity, note}} -- 2026-08-24,
//     direct correction: the original version of this script used
//     safeForConditions as a hard include/exclude gate on "Meals You Can
//     Eat," which directly contradicted this app's own standing
//     healing-stage rule ("advisory and reordering only, never gating")
//     and, combined with a wide criteria net, meant only near-single-
//     ingredient recipes could ever pass for a condition like
//     Hashimoto's (confirmed directly: its own "safe" list was 18 of
//     300, every one a fermented drink, zero actual meals). A recipe
//     that trips a flag for a condition is no longer excluded -- it gets
//     a real, computed one-sentence caution here instead, naming the
//     specific flagged ingredient (the single most severe hit, red
//     before yellow) and what the flag means, built from the same tier
//     vocabulary the rest of this app already uses. One entry per
//     flagged condition; a condition absent here for a given recipe
//     means that recipe is genuinely clean for it (already reflected in
//     safeForConditions too).
//
//     2026-08-25, direct correction to the correction: "All of the
//     conditions list all 300 meals saying they can eat all of them.
//     That cannot be." Correct -- treating every caution as
//     interchangeable made a serious, well-documented concern (Gluten:
//     High Risk for Celiac, never safe in any amount) read the same as a
//     mild, portion-aware one (Sodium: Moderate). `severity` ('yellow' |
//     'red') is now recorded alongside `note`, the worse of the two
//     outcomes across every real hit for that condition (matching
//     pickCautionHit's own red-first rule), so the UI can group and
//     color genuinely differently instead of flattening every flag into
//     one undifferentiated "caution."
//
//   stageAdvisoryNotes: {condition, note}[] -- real, computed
//     RecipeConditionNote-shaped entries, one per (staged condition x
//     food-relevant stage) that actually fires for this recipe's own
//     ingredients, using the EXACT same rule logic as each condition's
//     own stage-advisory file (ported here as pure functions, not
//     reinvented). Only the 6 conditions with a real staging model
//     (lib/conditionStages.ts) produce anything. Deliberately additive
//     to recipes.ts's own existing hand-written conditionNotes, never
//     replacing them -- these are a real, different, mechanically
//     computed kind of note (stage-specific), appended alongside the
//     hand-verified general ones already there.

// Rank (the actual calibrated risk verdict: "Use Carefully"/"High

// for a sub-criterion whose tier IS the verdict (Sodium: High really

// buckwheat, sweet potato -- genuinely a "cook it, pair with calcium"
// caution, not a serious concern) could still get captioned red purely

// spinach and chia seeds genuinely agree red across all three real
// measures (a real, serious caution, correctly still red), while

// SUB_CRITERIA already is, for a different but related reason: not
// near-universal noise, but a raw measurement duplicating a properly-
// calibrated sibling sub-criterion for the identical real fact.

// TOLERANCE_NOTE_SUB_CRITERION_BY_RANK below), never meant to
// independently drive severity or get picked as its own hit -- tier
// values here are long, cited sentences ("High oxalate load (real cited

// directly contradicted this app's own standing healing-stage rule
// ("advisory and reordering only, never gating" -- CLAUDE.md), and
// combined badly with a wide criteria net (Hashimoto's own 25 relevant
// sub-criteria): more ingredients means more chances to trip one single
// flag somewhere, so only near-single-ingredient recipes (fermented
// drinks) could ever pass, exactly the reported symptom. Confirmed by

// 18 of 300, every one of them a fermented drink, zero actual meals.
//
// Fix: safeForConditions is kept (a recipe with zero relevant flags is

// template so it reads naturally combined with a real ingredient name
// rather than the generic "this food"/"this factor" pronouns that
// module's own UI-context version uses).
// Deliberately structured as "Ingredient: rated Tier for factor. <plain
// explanation>" rather than making the ingredient name the grammatical
// subject of a verb -- a first version tried that ("Flax seeds skews
// unfavorably...") and broke on subject-verb agreement for any plural
// ingredient name, since there's no reliable way to detect an arbitrary
// base_name's grammatical number. The colon-plus-explanation form needs
// no agreement at all, and the explanation sentence uses "This," never
// the ingredient name, as its own subject for the same reason.
