-- One row is one sealed blob waiting for one person, from one other person.
-- The primary key is what makes a resend replace rather than accumulate: what
-- is here is the latest thing somebody sent, not a history.
--
-- Nothing in this table is readable by the relay. `body` is the sealed wire
-- exactly as the sending phone produced it, and both fingerprints are the
-- public halves of keys this server has never seen the private side of.

  to_fp      TEXT NOT NULL,
  -- Who put it there. Checked against a signature before the row is written,
  -- so this one is not merely a claim the way a filename would be.
  from_fp    TEXT NOT NULL,

-- holds that key. Written only by a request signed with the mailbox's own key,
-- so nobody can point somebody else's wake-ups at their own phone. The wake-up
-- this enables carries nothing but the word that mail is waiting: no sender, no
-- size, no content. It is one more thing the relay knows (that a fingerprint
-- belongs to some Android phone Google can reach), and it is written down here
-- rather than glossed over.

-- that same secret, so nothing here can be opened or traced back to a code.
