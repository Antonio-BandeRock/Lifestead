// Where the OneDrive app registration's details live.
//
// One file, so the value someone pastes into a portal and the value this app
// sends are the same value, rather than two that can drift.
//
// WHY THERE IS A REGISTRATION AT ALL. Sharing a meal plan between two phones
// needs somewhere to put it, and the agreed answer is each person's own
// OneDrive rather than a server belonging to this project. Microsoft will not
// let an app touch someone's OneDrive without a registered application id, and
// that registration is something a person creates, not something code can.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: a client secret. This is a PUBLIC client. A
// secret shipped inside an app is not a secret, since anyone can read it out of
// the bundle, so the authorization code is protected by PKCE instead: a random
// value generated per sign-in, hashed, and checked by Microsoft against the
// original. expo-crypto provides the randomness and the hash, both already
// installed.

/**
 * What this app asks permission to do.
 *
 * WIDENED 2026-09-07, DELIBERATELY, AND THE COST IS REAL. Files.ReadWrite.All
 * covers everything the signed-in person can reach: their own OneDrive AND
 * anything shared with them. Nothing narrower reaches a shared folder, and a
 * shared folder is the entire point, since a mailbox one person can see is not
 * a mailbox. Files.ReadWrite.AppFolder was tried first and only ever reaches a
 * folder Microsoft creates for this app, which nobody else can be given access
 * to. Files.ReadWrite covers the signing-in person's own drive and stops at the
 * boundary of it, so a folder a partner made and shared is out of reach.
 *
 * The consent screen says so in Microsoft's own words, and the app says so in
 * its own before sending anybody to it. What the app actually does with the
 * access is narrower than what it has to ask for: it lists folders so somebody
 * can pick one, then reads and writes files inside that one folder. It never
 * touches anything else, and nothing in the code goes looking.
 *
 * WHY ANDROID COULD NOT DO THIS INSTEAD, checked on a real phone rather than
 * assumed. OneDrive's Android document provider answers a request to open a
 * FILE and refuses a request to open a FOLDER or create one, so a folder picker
 * built on the Storage Access Framework cannot show OneDrive at all. That is
 * OneDrive's decision, not something app code can work around.
 *
 * offline_access is what allows a refresh token, so signing in happens once
 * rather than every time the app wants to check for something new.
