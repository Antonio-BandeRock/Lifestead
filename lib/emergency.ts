// What someone else needs to know when you cannot tell them.
//
// Built 2026-09-05. Life's fifth area, and the second half of the answer to
// what else Life should hold.
//
// THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THIS FILE IS A WARNING, NOT A FEATURE.
//
// An app on a locked phone is NOT reachable by a paramedic. Nobody is going to
// find this. If someone comes away believing this replaces a bracelet, a wallet
// card, or the medical ID screen a phone already has, they are worse off than before
// they started, because they will have stopped carrying the thing that does
// work.
//
// So that is said first, plainly, on the screen and not in a footnote, and
// NOT_A_MEDICAL_ALERT below is the wording. This is a record to show someone,
// read out, or hand over. It is useful for a spouse, a neighbour, an intake
// desk, a new doctor. It is not an alert system.
//
// WHAT WAS ALREADY HERE, AND THE ONE THING THAT WAS NOT.
//
// The app already holds tracked conditions, active medications with doses, food
// allergies, and healing stage. None of it is reachable by anyone but the
// person, which is the gap this closes: it assembles what exists rather than
// asking for it twice.
//
// Checked rather than assumed, and it turned up the field that matters most:
// the app tracks FOOD allergies and has no concept of a DRUG allergy at all.
// A penicillin allergy is not a food allergy, and on an emergency card it is
// arguably the single highest-stakes line there is. That gap is closed here.
//
// TWO RULES THIS FILE HOLDS.
//
// 1. Nothing is inferred, ever. Drug allergies especially are exactly what the
//    person typed, because this is text a clinician may act on within minutes.
//    No autocomplete from a food allergy, no guessing from a medication.
//
// 2. Staleness is stated. A card listing a medication stopped six months ago is
//    worse than no card, so every reading carries how long since it was last
//    confirmed, and says plainly when that is too long ago to trust. Same rule
//    the kitchen inventory already holds about an amount nothing decrements.
