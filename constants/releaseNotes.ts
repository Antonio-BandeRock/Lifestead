//
// 2026-08-29, direct report after the first successful OTA update ever
// reached a phone: "When the user checks for updates, the app just
// restarts. It doesn't give any warning about what is going to happen, or
// what to do when it starts again, or if an update was applied or if
// there was any update at all... Please make sure the user is aware of
// what will happen, or has happened, and provide a informational thing
// after the update is applied to tell that an update was actually
// applied, and what did that update include for changes."
//
// This file is the "what did that update include" half. The version
// number changing on screen (see constants/version.ts and
// components/VersionLabel.tsx) proved an update landed, but proved
// nothing about WHAT landed, which is the part that actually matters to
// someone using the app rather than building it.
//
// Named honestly rather than faked: this starts at the versions below,
// not at 1.0.0. Writing a plausible-sounding changelog for the ~100
// earlier versions after the fact would mean inventing history, against
// this project's own standing evidence-honesty rule. A version with no
// entry here is handled gracefully at the display end (see
// getReleaseNotesSince), never shown as an empty or invented list.
//
// STANDING MAINTENANCE RULE, the same discipline APP_VERSION itself
// already carries (see constants/version.ts): whenever a version bump
// ships something a person would actually notice, add its entry here in
// the same pass. A purely internal bump (a build-mechanism fix, a test
// publish) correctly gets no entry, and the display end handles that.
