// Your Story: a guided way through the app, laid out as the sections of a
// person's paper.
//
// 2026-09-24, direct request: "a way to make sure the user knows the most
// efficient way for the app to do for them what we are intending for it to
// do... we need to have them available from the home screen where they are
// linked to the thing they should do. But if it disappears from that list,
// there is enough to the app that it might not be easy to remember how to
// get back there again." The design conversation settled on a book that is
// also a newspaper: the whole of somebody's life in sections, each one
// filled in from what they record. Notion holds the Decision row.
//
// WHAT HOLDS, and a later session will be tempted to soften:
//
// 1. An item is done when the RECORD exists, never when a box is ticked.
//    Nothing here stores "done"; lib/yourStoryDb.ts looks for the record
//    each time. your_story_items only remembers the day an item was first
//    seen done (so a removed record can say when it had been there) and
//    any item the person set aside.
// 2. No step numbers, no percentages, no progress bars, no praise, no
//    blame. scripts/test_your_story.js sweeps every sentence here for
//    both. A waiting item says how close it is in the person's
//    counts ("2 of the 7 days"), which is a statement about what the
//    analysis needs and never about the person.
// 3. Nothing promises the app will find causes. The Inside Story items
//    say what each view can show once there is enough to show it.
// 4. The parts of life (beats, in code; the word never reaches the screen)
//    are a CLOSED list of nine. This is a written exception to the
//    open-lists rule: a beat is a section of this guide with items written
//    for it, and a beat somebody named would be a section with nothing in
//    it. Beats shape Your Story only and never hide a tab or a feature.
// 5. The Home card can be folded and moved and can NOT be turned off, the
//    second written exception (see isHomeSectionVisible in
//    lib/visualPreferences.ts). Folded, it is one line naming the next
//    thing, which is also the "one clear next thing on Home" CLAUDE.md
//    open step 28 asked for.
//
// PURE. No database, no React, no runtime imports, so
// scripts/test_your_story.js runs it in plain node.
