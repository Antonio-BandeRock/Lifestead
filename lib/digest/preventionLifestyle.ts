// Prevention & Lifestyle — a new Basic Health topic, 2026-08-08, direct request:
// "Include a category for any of them that it can apply to, how to avoid
// problems with this condition, and then explain what they would need to
// change in their life about what they eat and how they exercise and how
// they maintain their macro and micro nutrients, and balance in their life
// and eating habits." Every one of the 19 tracked conditions gets a real
// entry here — for the genuinely preventable/lifestyle-driven conditions
// (Type 2 Diabetes, MASLD, gout, CVD, PCOS) this is real primary-prevention
// guidance; for the autoimmune/genetic conditions (Hashimoto's, T1D, celiac,
// lupus, MS, RA, Graves', Sjögren's, psoriasis, IBD), where lifestyle can't
// prevent the underlying disease, it's real, honestly-framed flare- and
// complication-reduction guidance instead — the distinction is stated
// directly in each entry, never blurred. Deliberately a SYNTHESIS layer, not
// new primary research: each entry pulls together diet, exercise,
// macro/micronutrient balance, and life balance from this Digest's own
// already-verified, already-cited condition-specific research (reusing those
// same real citations, not inventing new unverified facts), plus the WHO's
// own real general physical-activity guideline where exercise volume is
// worth stating plainly. Tagged 'basicHealth' throughout, per the direct
// request that this "probably fits best in the Basic Health section" — a
// real, general how-to-live-well framework with condition-specific notes,
// not disease-specific medical management (which stays in each condition's
// own category, as this whole Digest has held to throughout).

What everyday choices DO shape is how well the condition is managed day to day.\n\nThe research supports a few concrete changes: keep iodine intake balanced rather than chasing either extreme (both deficiency and excess can worsen thyroid autoimmunity, dose-dependent research covers this directly); keep selenium intake adequate, since even mild deficiency tracks with worse autoimmune activity; take levothyroxine on an empty stomach, separated from calcium, iron, coffee, and high-fiber meals by the intervals the labs research already establishes; favor a whole-food, fiber-rich, moderately fermented diet that supports the gut barrier the microbiome research ties directly to autoimmune activity; and keep exercise moderate, rather than either sedentary or extreme, since both under-eating and overtraining can suppress T3 through the same cortisol/HPA-axis pathway covered in the mitochondria research. The World Health Organization's general activity target, 150 to 300 minutes of moderate exercise weekly plus muscle-strengthening work twice a week, is a reasonable, unremarkable-feeling starting point, not an extreme one.",

Diet: a RCT-backed Mediterranean pattern (olive oil, legumes, vegetables, fish) measurably reduces disease activity, and omega-3 dosing above 2.7 grams daily for at least 3 months reduces NSAID reliance.\n\nSmoking cessation is the single most consequential change available, research ties smoking directly to the citrullination process that drives RA's antibody response, and quitting is one of the few RA risk factors a person can fully control. Exercise should be regular and moderate, not avoided out of fear of joint pain (research finds appropriate exercise reduces inflammation, not just maintains function) and not pushed to exhaustion.\n\nBone protection matters directly: adequate calcium and vitamin D offset the fracture risk from glucocorticoid treatment.

    summary:
      "Psoriasis has a genetic starting point (HLA-Cw6 and related markers), but the research finds several everyday factors that move how severe it runs. Weight loss carries RCT-backed benefit, even a modest reduction measurably lowers PASI severity scores, and a Mediterranean-pattern diet shows the same effect independently. Alcohol and smoking both carry dose-dependent worsening effects, quitting or cutting back on either is a direct lever, not just general health advice.\n\nA less obvious factor: physical trauma to the skin itself, a scratch, a sunburn, a tattoo, can trigger a brand-new psoriasis patch at that exact site (the Koebner phenomenon), so protecting skin from unnecessary injury is a practical habit. Regular, moderate exercise supports the same weight and cardiometabolic benefits already tied to lower severity, and stress management matters directly too, psoriasis research under Conditions ties stress to flare timing.

      "Graves' disease is autoimmune and can't be prevented by lifestyle once the underlying genetic and immune process is set in motion, but the research names one dominant modifiable factor above the rest: smoking. Meta-analysis-level evidence ties smoking directly to both a higher risk of developing Graves' disease and, more strongly, to worse thyroid eye disease specifically, making smoking cessation the single most consequential lifestyle change available.\n\nIodine needs careful balance in the opposite direction from Hashimoto's: excess iodine can trigger or worsen Graves' disease in a genetically susceptible person, so avoiding high-dose iodine supplements and excessive seaweed/kelp intake matters directly, covered in Graves' iodine research under Conditions.\n\nA newer body of evidence ties chronic stress to Graves' onset in genetically susceptible people, making stress management a legitimate, evidence-grounded lever, not just general advice.

    summary:
      "Type 1 diabetes results from an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells that begins well before diagnosis, the staging research confirms it can be detected years earlier via antibody testing, but no known diet or lifestyle change stops or prevents that underlying process. What everyday choices DO shape is how well the condition is managed once it's here. Carbohydrate counting accuracy matters directly, the research finds an average 21% error rate in typical carb estimates, and closing that gap measurably improves glucose stability.\n\nExercise carries complexity, aerobic exercise can drop glucose while resistance exercise can sometimes raise it, so timing and type both matter, not just volume, and the alcohol research adds a delayed-hypoglycemia risk to plan around specifically. Bone health deserves direct attention given the sevenfold hip-fracture-risk finding, weight-bearing and resistance exercise are a protective lever here specifically.

    summary:
      "Celiac disease is unusual in this app: it has exactly one effective prevention strategy, and it's binary rather than a spectrum of moderation. Once diagnosed, strict, lifelong avoidance of gluten, including attention to cross-contamination (shared cooking water, shared toasters, mislabeled products), is the only treatment that stops ongoing intestinal damage. What needs active management alongside that: the research finds commercial gluten-free products often run lower in protein and fiber and higher in sugar and cost than their gluten-containing equivalents, so a whole-food gluten-free pattern (naturally gluten-free grains, vegetables, lean protein) matters more than simply swapping in packaged gluten-free substitutes.\n\nDeliberate attention to iron, folate, B12, vitamin D, calcium, and zinc is worth building into a regular diet, since the research finds these can run short on a gluten-free diet if not actively managed. Bone-protective, weight-bearing exercise matters directly given the bone-density findings at diagnosis, and regular dental checkups are worth keeping given the documented enamel-defect risk.",

    summary: "Inflammatory bowel disease has genetic and environmental triggers, and while lifestyle can't prevent the underlying disease from developing, it shapes flare frequency and severity. Smoking needs careful, disease-specific framing: it's a documented risk factor for developing and worsening Crohn's disease, but carries a paradoxical protective effect specifically against ulcerative colitis, meaning the right smoking-related guidance depends on which specific IBD diagnosis someone has.\n\nA direct correction: the common advice to restrict fiber during a flare has surprisingly thin evidence behind it, the research found no support for the restriction and, more strikingly, found higher fiber intake tracking with LOWER flare risk within six months. Vitamin D deficiency tracks directly with disease severity, adequate levels are a worthwhile target. Regular, moderate exercise, adequate hydration, and stress management all support the same gut-barrier and inflammation pathways covered throughout the gut-microbiome research, and NSAIDs are worth avoiding given their documented flare-triggering potential.",

Smoking cessation carries direct evidence for reducing both onset risk and disease progression. Vitamin D deserves careful framing: it's strongly linked to MS risk in observational research, but the trial evidence for SUPPLEMENTATION specifically is mixed, adequate levels are still a reasonable, low-risk target.\n\nDiet carries quantified benefit: the WAVES trial, found both the Swank (very low saturated fat) and Wahls (nutrient-dense, plant-forward) diets produced clinically meaningful fatigue and quality-of-life improvement, sharing a common thread of whole-food, limited-processed-food eating. Exercise needs one MS-specific caution, Uhthoff's phenomenon, temporary symptom worsening from overheating during exertion, meaning cooling strategies matter as much as exercise volume itself.

Omega-3 shows modest, low-certainty benefit per the meta-analysis. Smoking cessation matters directly, and anyone in mining, construction, sandblasting, or similar industrial work should know about the documented silica-dust exposure risk, a modifiable occupational factor.

      "Migraine management centers on everyday consistency more than eliminating any one specific food, and the research includes a correction to some of the most common migraine advice: tyramine, the compound long blamed for aged-cheese and red-wine triggers, has documented problems as an explanation, and chocolate's evidence is mixed rather than a clear culprit. What evidence DOES support: a consistent sleep schedule and consistent meal timing (never skipping meals) both matter directly, since irregularity itself is a documented trigger.\n\nA specific combination, magnesium, riboflavin, and CoQ10 together, showed randomized trial benefit, reducing migraine days measurably more than either component alone might suggest. Caffeine carries complexity: it can be both a trigger for some people and a withdrawal-headache cause for others, sometimes through the very same medication, making CONSISTENCY (not necessarily elimination) the more reliable lever. Adequate hydration and regular, moderate (not suddenly intense) exercise both help, and stress-management techniques carry modest supporting evidence.",

    teaser: "CVD's levers: a Mediterranean or DASH-style whole-food pattern, quantified exercise volume, smoking cessation, and sodium moderation all trace back to the same foundational Seven Countries Study.",
    summary:
      "Cardiovascular disease responds directly and substantially to everyday choices, the Seven Countries Study first established the connection at international scale, finding southern European, Mediterranean-diet-following populations carrying roughly half the cardiovascular disease rate of northern European populations.\n\nThe practical version of that same finding: a whole-food pattern built around olive oil, legumes, vegetables, and fish, low in saturated fat and processed food, is the single best-evidenced dietary lever in this whole category. Exercise carries quantified benefit at the WHO's general 150 to 300 minute weekly target, and the cardiac-rehabilitation research finds a 26 to 31% mortality reduction from structured post-event exercise programs specifically.\n\nSmoking cessation and sodium moderation (the same DASH-aligned target) both carry strong, direct evidence. Alcohol needs careful framing given the research, cardiovascular risk exists, but the evidence doesn't support a single simple rule the way smoking cessation does. Regular blood pressure and lipid-panel monitoring (see Self Advocacy) matters directly, since much of the risk-reduction value of diet and exercise only becomes visible through tracking these numbers over time.",

    teaser: "Gout's levers: research found meat and seafood raise risk while dairy is protective, sugar-sweetened drinks and beer both carry dose-dependent risk, and even modest weight loss shows a quantified benefit.",
    summary:
      "Gout responds directly to specific dietary choices, and the landmark cohort study found something more specific than the generic 'avoid all purines' advice most people hear: meat carried a 41% higher risk and seafood a 51% higher risk, while dairy carried a 44% LOWER risk in the very same study, a protective association, not just a neutral one. Purine-rich vegetables and total protein overall were NOT associated with increased risk at all in that same research, directly countering the assumption that all purines behave identically.\n\nBeer carries the strongest alcohol-related risk of any type studied (49% higher per daily serving), while wine showed no significant association. Sugar-sweetened beverages carry dose-dependent risk up to 85% higher at 2 or more daily servings. Weight loss shows quantified benefit across multiple intervention types. Three specific protective foods carry trial support: cherries, vitamin C (500mg/day in a RCT), and coffee (both caffeinated and decaf). Adequate hydration and avoiding known urate-lowering-therapy interactions (see the gout medication entries under Conditions) round out the practical picture.",

    summary: "Prostate health responds to everyday choices backed by some of the strongest evidence that diet changes individual risk. The migrant studies found men who moved from a low-incidence country to a high-incidence one saw their prostate cancer risk rise 4 to 12-fold within one generation, direct proof that environment and diet, not just genetics, drive most of the worldwide 30-fold incidence gap. Lycopene (concentrated in cooked tomatoes) and cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, the same sulforaphane compound) both carry dose-response trial support.\n\nRegular exercise carries a direct mortality benefit. Everyday choices: limiting processed and charred meat, moderating choline intake given the gut-bacteria-to-TMAO pathway, and keeping zinc intake adequate given the prostate's distinctive tissue concentration of it. Weight management and moderate alcohol both matter, and regular PSA and symptom monitoring (see Self Advocacy) is worth pursuing alongside diet and exercise, not instead of them.",
