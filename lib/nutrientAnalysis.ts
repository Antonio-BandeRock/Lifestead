// "0.8 mg"), a whole number at or above it (nothing here needs more
// precision than that once the amount is already in double digits). Used

// 2026-08-14, direct report: "tomato powder has 46260 ug of Lycopene...
// why portray it in ug if the number is so big?" -- checked the number
// itself directly against the real USDA FoodData Central API before
// touching anything (fdcId 170461, "Tomato powder": 46300 µg, matching
// this app's own stored 46260 µg to within a trivial rounding difference
// -- a genuinely, physically plausible figure for an intensely dehydrated
// product, confirmed via this same food's own water content, 3.06g/100g,
// and calorie density, 302 kcal/100g, both consistent with ~95%+ of the
// water having been removed). The number and the column were both
// correct; the READING was the real, fixable problem. Checked how common
// this actually is across the whole database before deciding how broadly
// to fix it -- iodine reaches 494,000 µg, vitamin A 145,455 µg RAE,
// folate 61,538 µg, and vitamin C reaches 100,000 mg (a pure ascorbic
// acid ingredient, genuinely 100% vitamin C by weight) -- a real, general
// readability problem for any sufficiently concentrated/dehydrated/
// supplement-style food, not a lycopene-specific quirk, so fixed
// generally here rather than patched for lycopene alone. Auto-scales a
// genuinely large µg amount up to mg, and mg up to g, once it reaches
// four digits -- deliberately NOT applied to `µg RAE` (vitamin A's own
// unit), which stays in µg in essentially every real clinical/nutrition
// reference regardless of magnitude, so scaling it to "mg RAE" would
// reduce recognizability rather than improve it; also not applied to `g`
