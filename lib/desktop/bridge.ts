// The one description of what desktop/preload.js puts on `window` for the
// Electron build. Every desktop stand-in in this folder reads the bridge
// through getDesktopBridge(), and desktop/preload.js is the other half of
// the contract: the two have to agree, and this file is where they agree.
//
// Nothing outside lib/desktop/ should need this. The Metro redirects in
// metro.config.js (LIFESTEAD_DESKTOP=1, web platform only) point
// expo-sqlite, expo-secure-store, expo-notifications and expo-file-system
// at the stand-ins, so the app's code keeps calling the packages it always
// called. The one exception is the shared folder: lib/oneDriveGraph.ts and
// lib/oneDriveAuth.ts ask isDesktopApp() themselves and hand the call to
// lib/desktop/cloudFolder.ts, since what changes there is not a package
// but where the folder is.
