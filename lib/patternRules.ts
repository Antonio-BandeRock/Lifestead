// Turning something the Pattern Finder noticed into one of the person's
// own saved rules. Asked for on 2026-09-23, and the last piece deliberately
// left out of the 2026-08-18 rules-engine build, where the architecture
// note named it directly: "you've logged fatigue within a day of
// high-goitrogen meals four times this month, want to turn that into a
// rule?"
//
// WHAT THIS CLOSES. Trends > Pattern Finder counts what was logged in the
// hours before each flare and lists whatever recurs. Until now the trail
// stopped there: the person read the count and had to carry it in their
// head, or retype it by hand on Insights > My Meds. The app was doing the
// correlation work and then handing the result back as homework, which is
// the opposite of the standing purpose (the complexity lives inside the
// app; what the person experiences is ease).
//
// THE APP SUGGESTS, THE PERSON DECIDES. Same standing rule the healing
// stages already follow. Nothing here saves anything: it proposes wording
// the person edits before it becomes theirs, and the wording it proposes
// is the COUNT FROM THEIR DATA and nothing more. It does not say a food
// caused anything, does not tell them to avoid it, and does not decide
// anything on their behalf. A pattern is a reason to look, and the lens
// itself already says so above the list.
//
// WHY THE PROPOSED TEXT IS ONLY THE FINDING. Writing "avoid broccoli" into
// the box would be the app making a call it has no evidence for, from a
// count on noisy n=1 data with every confound still in it. So the proposal
// states what was counted, in the person's voice, and the form asks them
// what they want to do about it. What they add is theirs, saved with
// source 'self' and labelled as something they noticed everywhere it shows.
//
// WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE CHECKED AFTERWARDS, SAID OUT LOUD. The rules
// engine matches a food-linked rule by looking for the person's keyword in
// the names of what they logged that day (lib/interactionRules.ts), so a
// rule about a specific food genuinely surfaces on the days it is relevant
// and stays quiet otherwise. A scoring factor and a food category have
// nothing in that engine to match against, so a rule made from one of
// those is saved unlinked and shows every day until it is paused. That is
// a worse rule, and the person is told which one they are about to get
// BEFORE they save it rather than discovering it as clutter a week later.
// Extending the engine to check a sub-criterion directly is the obvious
// next step and is named in interactionRules.ts as a cheap future addition;
// this module is written so that day changes one function.
