// A real, deterministic sort applied to every rendered group of entries
// (a Basic Health topic/subtopic leaf list, a condition's own topic
// shelf) -- 2026-08-08, direct request: "there seems to be a randomness
// to how the data within each Digest area are being listed from start to
// finish or which other information is next to them. There needs to be an
// order to sorting applied to the group of each area so even if the user
// just decides to scroll around and look at random things it should all
// track in a logical order in each section." Before this, a group's own
// entries rendered in whatever order they happen to sit in the source
// array -- which reflects the literal order they were WRITTEN across many
// separate build passes over many days (an entry added in an early batch
// sits before one covering a closely related topic added weeks later),
// not any real reading order, so scrolling through felt arbitrary.
//
// The fix: within any one group, an "-overview" entry (at most one per
// condition/topic) always leads, a "tying-together" synthesis entry (if
// present in this same group -- a condition's own is already pulled out
// into its own standalone card by groupConditionEntries below, but a
// Basic Health topic can genuinely have one sitting right in its own leaf
// list) always trails, and everything in between sorts alphabetically by
// its own real title (or food name, for a ProblemFoodEntry). Alphabetical
// is the one ordering scheme that's fully deterministic, needs zero
// per-topic editorial judgment call, and lets someone scanning a list
// predict roughly where a given entry should sit -- the same "logical,
// not random" standard this request asks for, applied identically
// everywhere rather than hand-curating a bespoke narrative order for the
// 60+ separate groups (18 conditions x up to 4 pillars, plus every Basic
// Health topic/subtopic) this would otherwise mean reviewing one at a
// time.
// 2026-09-19: alphabetical order is wrong for the few shelves that tell a
// story in sequence. Earth Matters' history shelf was showing the 2017
// certification era before the 1972 origins before the Green Revolution
// that both respond to; "Do boycotts work?" came after the entry that
// answers "buycotts are too"; the Horticulture zone entries ran tropical,
// cold, moderate, warm. Each list below is one shelf's reading order. An
// id in a list sorts by its position, ahead of anything unlisted on the
// same shelf; everything unlisted keeps the alphabetical fallback, so a
// condition page (none of whose ids appear here) is unchanged.

// search utility [t]he user shouldn't need to dig looking for something...
// I want them to see something and take an interest to want to read more
// on their own." Four broad pillars was flattening real, specific,
// individually-inviting topics (Pregnancy & Family Planning, Mental
// Health, a condition's own Global Perspective/Research Horizon research)
// down into generic buckets nobody would tap out of curiosity. This
// version surfaces those real clusters as their own real shelves instead.
//
// Same "reasonable v1 heuristic" discipline as the version it replaces,
// and as every other grouping mechanism in this file (Basic Health's own
// id-prefix matching) and elsewhere in this app (lib/foodNameGrouping.ts)
// -- computed from each entry's own id and title/food name at render time,
// NOT hand-reviewed entry by entry across 900+ condition entries, and NOT
// stored as a new field on DigestEntry (the same reasoning
// BASIC_HEALTH_TOPICS above already gives for its own choice). Verified
// against every real entry across all 19 conditions before shipping (a
// throwaway Node script mirroring this exact logic, run against the real
// content files) -- every condition landed 8-17 real, non-empty topic
// shelves (up from a fixed 4), with every singleton-sized shelf spot-
// checked by hand and confirmed to be a real, correctly-placed, single
// entry (e.g. a condition with exactly one Mental Health finding still
// deserves its own real "Mental Health" shelf, not folding into a bigger,
// vaguer bucket). Worth a further spot-check once seen on-device -- some
// entries will still land in a less-than-ideal topic (keyword heuristics
// always do), the same standing caveat the original pillar version and
// every other grouping feature in this app already ships under.

// 2026-08-25, direct follow-up after Basic Health's own oversized topics
// were split into real subtopics: "Yes, throughout the Digest. Everything
// must have continuity throughout the Digest." A real per-(condition,
// topic) count (a throwaway Node script reimplementing classifyConditionTopic
// above against every real entry, not guessed) found this exact same
// "one continuous scrolling shelf" problem inside 18 separate (condition,
// topic) shelves across 11 different conditions, several worse than
// anything Basic Health had (prostateHealth's own Core Science bucket
// alone held 30 entries in one shelf). Every one of these 18 groupings
// was designed by reading every real title in that shelf, the same
// discipline as Basic Health's own subtopics, not guessed from the topic
// name alone.
//
// Keyed by the entries' own real `category` field (a DigestCategoryKey,
// confirmed identical to what classifyConditionTopic's caller already
// has on hand) rather than by conditionCode -- groupConditionEntries
// below is handed a mixed conditionCode/entries pairing whose exact
// casing convention isn't worth re-deriving here when entry.category is
// already the one reliable, already-present source of truth.
//
// A topic/condition pair with no entry here is untouched, rendering
// exactly as one flat shelf as before -- most (condition, topic) pairs
// are genuinely small enough (2-10 entries) that further subdivision
// would only fragment them for no real benefit, matching the same
// judgment call Basic Health's own smaller topics (Neurogenesis,
// Depletion, Mitochondria & Metabolism, and so on) were left alone under.
// 2026-08-29: widened from ConditionTopic to a plain string key so Earth
// Matters and Home Gardening topics can declare subgroups through the same
// mechanism, rather than only condition pages being able to. Direct
// request to make absolutely sure EVERY shelf in Digest gets split when it
// covers more than one thing, not just the condition ones.

// gate that meant a wide-criteria condition like Hashimoto's (25 real
// relevant sub-criteria) could only ever show near-single-ingredient
// recipes, confirmed directly: 18 of 300, every one a fermented drink,
// zero actual meals. Buckets BOTH halves separately (genuinely clean,

// to be based on the condition categories," since every RECIPES_ENTRIES
// row was falling through classifyTopicForCategory's own default branch
// straight into classifyConditionTopic (the disease-oriented one, meant for
// Core Science/Self-Advocacy/Whole-Body Effects, none of which mean
// anything for a recipe). Unlike Earth Matters/Home Gardening, this one
// doesn't need a keyword net at all -- every real recipe entry already
// carries a genuine, structured `linkedBuilderType` field (see recipes.ts's
// own header comment: it's what lets DigestCard's "Build This Recipe"
// button navigate into the right builder), so classification is a direct,
// reliable field lookup rather than an inferred guess from title text.
