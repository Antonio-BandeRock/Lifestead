// The Digest's own content types -- built 2026-08-05 alongside its
// promotion from a placeholder Stack-push screen to a real tab (see
// app/(tabs)/purple-digest.tsx's own header comment). Two shapes, not one:
// most of this tab's content is DigestEntry (a citation-backed finding,
// same evidence-tier discipline as everywhere else in this app -- see
// lib/sixDimensionsReference.ts's own tier system, which this deliberately
// echoes rather than invents a second one) -- but the person explicitly
// asked for a second, more PRACTICAL kind of content too: "talk about the
// various foods that are a problem, and why, and how to get around those
// problems." That's ProblemFoodEntry -- food-first, swap-first, teaching
// general food literacy rather than reviewing a body of evidence.
//
// Every citation here is a compressed pointer (short attribution + a real
// PMID/DOI where one exists), not a full bibliography entry -- the point is
// letting someone verify a claim exists in the literature, not reproducing
// the literature itself.
//
// 2026-09-18: the `stageNote` field is gone from every entry and from this
// file. It rendered as an unlabelled grey italic line under the citations,
// and 44 of its 205 values were commentary about why an entry had been put
// on a shelf rather than anything about the subject. Direct instruction was
// to delete all of them. Do not reintroduce a freeform note field here: an
// entry's evidence strength belongs in `overallTier` and in each citation's
// own tier, where it is labelled and legible.

// Type-only import, erased entirely at compile time -- no real runtime
// circular dependency risk, the same precedent lib/sixDimensionsReference.ts
// -> lib/db.ts already established (see this app's own 2026-08-08 Insights
// Nutrient Ranking entry in CLAUDE.md). Confirmed directly before adding
// this: lib/db.ts imports nothing from lib/digest, and no lib/digest/*.ts
