// per-food test history (getFoodTrialHistory), a best-effort allergy
// check, and real Schedule-driven daily reminders for the length of the

// today go" check-in -- escalating to the same full tag/severity/notes
// CheckinForm every other lens here already uses only when something
// actually feels off, per the confirmed design. A trial always runs its
// full window by default regardless of a mid-window report (see
// lib/db.ts's own cancelFoodTrialCheckins comment) -- only the existing,
