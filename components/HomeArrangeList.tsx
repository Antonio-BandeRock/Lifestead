// Arranging Home from Home, 1.0.39.16. Direct request:
//
//   "the ability to long hold on a Home screen group that causes it to be
//   able to be dragged and dropped into a new order on the screen and to be
//   turned off from the Home screen... And the same for the quick access
//   items in each group, they should also be able to be dragged and dropped
//   to change the order if there are more than one, and also turned off
//   from being seen... So, maybe we have each group be turned on and off
//   from the Home group? That way it's available without having to go to
//   Profile at all."
//
// Holding any band on Home hands the page to this list. Everything becomes
// one row of its own name: the eleven group names, and under whichever one
// is open, the cards inside it. Drag a row by its grip and the rest shift
// to make room. Tap the eye to turn something off, tap it again to turn it
// back on, which is the part that keeps the whole job on this page: a group
// that vanished the moment it was switched off could only be recovered from
// Profile, so a switched-off group stays right here, greyed, saying so.
//
// Profile's own Home Screen card still does all of this and stays the place
// to go for a sweep. This is the same settings, reachable where they are
// being looked at.
//
// Why every row folds to its name while arranging: order is the only thing
// being decided, the content is in the way of seeing it, and uniform rows
// are what make a drag land where the finger says. Picking up a group also
// closes whatever was open underneath, for the same reason.
//
// The list opens where the hold happened, 1.0.39.19: "If I long press a
// sub category, they should be what I see when the ability to move them
// pops up. I didn't realize I needed to select the name of the group to
// get to the sub items." So holding a card hands over that card (openFor)
// and the group it lives in is already open, with its cards showing and
// ready to be dragged. Holding a group's own name still starts on the
// group names, because that is the thing that gesture is about.
//
// The drag is React Native's own PanResponder, deliberately. A drag-and-drop
// library would be a new dependency, and a new dependency changes the EAS
// fingerprint, which strands every phone's over-the-air updates until a full
// rebuild reaches it. That is a steep price for a list of a dozen rows. The
// responder lives on the grip alone, so the page underneath still scrolls
// normally everywhere else.
//
// Three things had to be right before a drop landed, 1.0.39.17: "I grab the
// grip on the right side it acts like it wants to move above or below the
// neighbor groups but it isn't allowed to do it."
//
//  1. Rows are ROW_HEIGHT tall but sit ROW_PITCH apart, because every
//     stacked band in this app leaves HOME_BAND_GAP under it. Counting
//     places by height alone had the arithmetic and the eye disagreeing
//     about where the row had got to.
//  2. A responder built during render is a different responder on the next
//     render, and setPlaces re-renders mid-gesture. The replacement never
//     received the grant, so it measured every later move from the top of
//     the screen instead of from where the finger went down. They are built
//     once each now and kept.
//  3. Home draws this list inside a ScrollView, and a finger travelling
//     straight down is exactly what a ScrollView believes belongs to it. The
//     grip refuses to hand the gesture over, and Home switches scrolling off
//     for as long as a row is held (onDragChange).
//
// What this list shows and what the page shows have to agree, 1.0.39.18:
// "Shared Folder Setup shows when I go to move groups but its not there
// when I select Done." A card can be off the page for either of two
// reasons, and only one of them belongs here. Switched off is a decision
// somebody made, so it stays on the list, greyed, waiting to be switched
// back on. Nothing to show today is not a decision at all: the shared
// folder card exists only while there is no shared folder yet, and the
// week trend only while there is a week to draw. Those are not rows.
// Home answers which is which through hasContent, and the drag counts
// places among the rows on screen, turning that back into places in the
// saved order at the moment it lands.
