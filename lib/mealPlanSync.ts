// The meal plan as a record of curated recipes, for sending and for holding
// what a partner sent.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. lib/partnerSync.ts has always had a place for a plan
// in its payload and every caller passed an empty array, so the one thing two
// people most obviously want to share was the one thing that never travelled.
// The reason was not the transport: it was that nothing on this phone could
// answer "which curated recipes are on my schedule?". scheduleMealPlanSlot
// resolves a slot's curated recipes into saved dishes and keeps the
// ingredients, the steps and the name, but not the recipe id it came from.
//
// So the fix is a record written at the moment a plan is scheduled
// (recordMealPlanSlot, in lib/db.ts, because that is where the scheduling
// happens) and read back here. Reconstructing the pointer afterwards by
// matching a dish name against curated_recipes would be guessing, and a plan
// that resolves to the wrong dish on somebody else's phone is worse than
// sending no plan at all.
//
// WHY THE TWO HALVES DO NOT SHARE A TABLE. meal_plan_slots is what this person
// scheduled. partner_meal_plan_slots is a copy of something another person
// owns, which never becomes a scheduled meal here. Keeping both in one table
// with an owner column would put exactly one WHERE clause between a partner's
// dinner and somebody's own schedule.
