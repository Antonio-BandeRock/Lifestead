// Whether Android lets reminders arrive at their time (2026-10-01).
//
// Direct report: "many times when I open the app, that is when an app
// notification happens." Android 14 and later do not let an app set an
// alarm to the minute until the person allows it under Alarms & reminders,
// and without that, expo-notifications falls back to the kind of alarm
// Android may hold while the phone sits idle, which then arrives the moment
// the phone is picked up. Battery restrictions can hold them back the same
// way. This module reads both through modules/reminder-timing, asks once
// (and again a week later if still off), and queues every reminder again
// the moment on-time alarms become allowed, since an alarm already queued
// keeps the kind it was set as.
//
// The native module is missing on a phone running a build from before
// 1.0.58.2, on iOS (which has no such setting) and on the desktop, and
// every reading here answers null for unknown rather than guessing.
