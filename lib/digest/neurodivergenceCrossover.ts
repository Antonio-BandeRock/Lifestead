// Where autism, ADHD and dyslexia cross into the 19 tracked conditions.
//
// 2026-09-17, direct instruction, the fourth part of it: "if any of them
// cross over into the tracked conditions, there should be entries made
// specifically."
//
// So this file is the "specifically" half. The general writing about
// autism, ADHD and dyslexia lives in lib/digest/neurodivergence.ts under
// Basic Health, where anybody can read it without tracking anything. What
// lives HERE is one entry filed inside a tracked condition's category,
// written for somebody who already has that condition and wants to know
// what, if anything, it has to do with these three.
//
// WHY ONE FILE AND NOT SIXTEEN. Every other per-condition module in this
// folder holds one condition. These sixteen entries are one subject seen
// from sixteen angles, and keeping them together is the only way to keep
// the tone and the honesty consistent across them. lib/digest/appHelps.ts
// already set that precedent with its 19 per-condition entries in one
// file. Each entry still carries its own condition `category`, so the
// Digest files them exactly where a per-condition module would have.
//
// HOW THEY FILE THEMSELVES. Two id shapes, both deliberate:
//   *-pregnan* ... lands in Pregnancy & Family Planning, because
//       purple-digest.tsx's classifier already routes any id containing
//       "pregnan" there. No classifier change needed for these seven.
//   *-crossover ... lands in Whole-Body Effects, via one added id check in
//       classifyConditionTopic. The suffix was chosen over the more
//       obvious "-adhd-" or "-autism-" marker because those would have
//       swept up the existing celiac-adhd-symptoms-mixed-evidence entry
//       and moved it out of Diet & Food, where it belongs.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE REFUSES TO DO. Three lines held in every entry below:
//   1. No claim that food or diet treats autism or ADHD. Where eating
//      enters, it enters as something the condition's management asks
//      for and that these traits make harder to keep up, never as therapy.
//   2. No maternal blame. Seven of these are about a parent's condition
//      and a child's development, which is the easiest content in this
//      whole Digest to write badly. Every one of them states the absolute
//      numbers next to the relative ones, names the treated-versus-
//      untreated split where a study found one, and says plainly that
//      nothing here explains any individual child.
//   3. No promoting an association to a cause. Several of these come from
//      health registers, which cannot separate a shared cause from a
//      causal one, and two of them (type 2 diabetes, PCOS) carry a
//      sibling or cousin comparison built to test exactly that. Both
//      halves get reported, including when the second half weakens the
//      first.
//
// AND ONE ENTRY IS A NULL. Multiple sclerosis is here because the question
// was asked and answered negatively. Leaving it out would have let anyone
// with MS read the silence as nobody having looked.

    summary:
      "A meta-analysis pooling 29 articles found maternal hypothyroidism associated with offspring ADHD at an odds ratio of 1.14 (1.03 to 1.26) and with an autism spectrum diagnosis at 1.41 (1.05 to 1.90). A large population cohort pointed the same way, at adjusted hazard ratios of 1.28 (1.19 to 1.37) for ADHD and 1.34 (1.19 to 1.51) for autism. Attach the baseline before reading those as alarming: they are small proportional increases on outcomes that affect a few percent of children, so most children of mothers with thyroid disease have neither. A later study split treated from untreated.\n\nAdequately treated chronic hypothyroidism was not significantly associated with offspring autism; thyroid levels that stayed out of range across trimesters were. That fits what is already known about the mechanism, since a fetus makes no thyroid hormone in the first trimester and runs entirely on what crosses from the mother, which is why timing and steadiness matter more than what the diagnosis is called. Test early, dose to the trimester target, and retest rather than assume. Nothing here explains any individual child, and nothing here is a reason to avoid having one.",

This category already asks for the same thing: hold levels in the trimester-appropriate range on the lowest antithyroid dose that does it, and monitor TRAb.

A Swedish study built to test that compared 21,280 children exposed to maternal PCOS against 200,816 unexposed children in the population and against 17,295 unexposed cousins, on the logic that cousins share a good deal of background that unrelated children do not.\n\nPart of the association survived the cousin comparison and part of it did not: shared familial factors account for some of it, and something else accounts for the rest, with prenatal androgen exposure the mechanism most often proposed and not yet demonstrated.

So this is not a new test to ask for; it is a second reason to pay attention to a result already in hand.

Why it happens is unsettled. Shared immune and inflammatory signalling is proposed. So is the plainer explanation that digestive symptoms are common in autism, which leads to more investigation, which finds more of everything that investigation finds.\n\nThe practical value here runs in the opposite direction to the statistic. Abdominal pain, urgency, weight loss and blood are easy to miss or misread in somebody who shows distress differently or who has been told for years that stomach trouble is part of being autistic, and IBD is a condition where a delayed diagnosis costs.

Three things follow. Irregular, rushed or skipped meals are common with ADHD and are also among the reliable triggers for IBS symptoms, which is one condition making the other harder rather than either causing the other.\n\nStimulant medication has digestive effects that are worth telling apart from the IBS instead of blaming one for the other.

      'A review of 14 studies found migraine and ADHD occurring together more often than chance would give, and found nothing of the kind for tension-type headache.',
    summary:
      "Pooling 14 studies, migraine was associated with ADHD at an odds ratio of 1.322 (1.018 to 1.717, p = 0.036), with no association for tension-type headache. A separate study of 26,456 adults put the figure higher at 1.81 (1.53 to 2.12), with the association appearing stronger for migraine with aura and in women.\n\nIf neurodivergent people simply reported more symptoms or attended more appointments, tension-type headache would have moved along with migraine and it did not. Shared ground in how the brain handles sensory input and arousal is the usual explanation offered, and it stays an explanation rather than a demonstrated mechanism. What is practical here has nothing to do with food.\n\nMigraine management leans on exactly the things ADHD makes hardest: noticing a pattern spread across weeks, taking an acute medication early enough in an attack for it to work, and keeping a preventive going every day with no immediate reward for having done so. A headache record that fills itself in from what is already being logged, and a reminder that does not depend on remembering, are worth more here than any trigger-food list, and the trigger lists are oversimplified anyway, as this category already says elsewhere.",

      'Children with both were reported at an HbA1c of 8.1 percent against 7.4 percent for type 1 diabetes alone. Results vary across studies, and treatment appears to matter.',
    summary:
      "Type 1 diabetes asks for the exact work ADHD makes hardest: counting carbohydrate at every meal, dosing against the count, checking, correcting, and having supplies on hand before they are needed. One study reported a mean HbA1c of 8.1 percent plus or minus 1.6 in children with both conditions against 7.4 percent plus or minus 1.2 in those with diabetes alone.\n\nFindings across studies are mixed rather than uniform, and in several of them patients treated with stimulant medication showed lower HbA1c and fewer complications than untreated patients with ADHD, which points at the executive-function load rather than at anything metabolic happening between the two conditions. Read this as a description of a difficulty, never as a description of a person, and never as a reason for a clinic to expect less.\n\nWhat helps is what helps anybody carrying too many steps: moving them out of the head and into something external. Dose reminders that fire at the time rather than waiting to be remembered, a log that can be filled in hours late without any penalty for the lateness, and carbohydrate figures already attached to the food rather than looked up again each time. None of that is nutrition treating ADHD. It is taking the remembering out of a task that punishes forgetting.",

      'Pooled studies put the association at more than twice the odds. Then a sibling comparison in the same paper asked whether it was ADHD at all, and largely answered no.',
    summary:
      "A systematic review with meta-analysis covering four studies and 5,738,287 participants reported type 2 diabetes associated with ADHD at an adjusted odds ratio of 2.29 (1.48 to 3.55), and a Taiwanese longitudinal study within it reported a hazard ratio of 3.28 (1.41 to 7.63). The same paper also carried a population-based sibling comparison, which holds family background roughly constant by comparing siblings who do and do not have ADHD, and that comparison indicated ADHD by itself has a negligible effect on type 2 diabetes risk once familial factors are accounted for.\n\nThe association exists and would show up for anyone looking at population numbers; the causal reading of it mostly does not survive a design built to test it. What survives is indirect: irregular eating, disrupted sleep and less movement each associate with metabolic risk on their own, and all three are harder to hold steady with ADHD. That is an argument for putting the routine somewhere outside the head, which is what this app is built to do, and not an argument for treating an ADHD diagnosis as a diabetes forecast.",

      'A large study found ADHD diagnoses somewhat more common in people with psoriasis, more so in women than men. Nobody has shown why.',
    summary:
      "ADHD was associated with psoriasis at an adjusted odds ratio of 1.57 (1.46 to 1.68) in women and 1.31 (1.23 to 1.40) in men. Those are modest increases, the sex difference has no settled explanation, and an association drawn from health records cannot separate a shared biological cause from the simpler possibility that people already under regular medical care collect more diagnoses of everything. Shared inflammatory signalling gets proposed and has not been demonstrated.\n\nThe useful part of this is on the treatment side rather than the cause side. Psoriasis treatment is mostly something a person administers to themselves on a schedule: a topical applied consistently for weeks before anything visible changes, phototherapy appointments to get to, bloods to keep up for a systemic drug. A treatment that only works if it is done daily and gives no immediate feedback for doing it is precisely the kind that slips, and calling that slipping a lack of motivation gets the problem backwards. Reminders, a visible record of what was actually applied and when, and a way to see change measured over weeks rather than looked for each morning in the mirror are the responses that fit the difficulty.",

      'Fatty liver sits among the conditions most strongly associated with adult ADHD in Swedish register data, and autistic children have been reported with it more often. The evidence is thin in both directions, and the route to it is not mysterious.',
    summary:
      "A genetically informed Swedish register study mapping physical conditions in adults with ADHD found elevated risk across 34 of 35 conditions examined, with fatty liver disease among those most strongly associated, alongside alcohol-related liver disease, sleep disorders, COPD, epilepsy and obesity.\n\nSeparately, a case-control study of children found autism associated with higher rates of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis alongside obesity, with part of that attributable to weight gained on antipsychotic and other medication rather than to autism itself. Both findings are weak by design: register associations cannot separate a cause from a shared cause, and a medication contribution makes part of the autism figure a treatment effect rather than a trait effect.\n\nThe path from either to a fatty liver needs nothing specific to neurodivergence to explain it. Irregular and narrow eating, high intake of sugar-sweetened drinks, disrupted sleep, less movement and weight gained on prescribed medication are all established contributors, and every one of them is harder to keep in check when daily structure is hard to hold. The reason to state this plainly rather than leave it out is that fatty liver is among the most reversible conditions in this app. If several of those describe the last few years, liver bloods are worth asking for.",
