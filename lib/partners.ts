// A partner link: two people, two phones, one dinner.
//
// Built 2026-09-06. The first real two-person connection in this app, and
// deliberately the first, because it is the concrete case that forces the
// pairing handshake to be finished rather than described.
//
// WHAT WAS ALREADY BUILT, AND WHY THIS IS SMALLER THAN IT LOOKS.
//
// The nutrition half is already done and was done without knowing it. The meal
// generator never asks who it is planning for: generateMealPlanDays takes
// conditionCodes as a plain array from its caller, and recipeSafeAcrossConditions
// already loops however many codes it is given. So combining two people's
// conditions is a merge of two arrays, not a new engine.
//
// What was genuinely missing is trust and transport, which is what this file and
// its callers are about.
//
// THE DESIGN DECISION EVERYTHING ELSE FOLLOWS FROM, decided directly:
// SHARED MEAL, PER-PERSON CAUTIONS.
//
// The obvious reading of "combine our conditions" is an intersection: show only
// meals safe for both. That is wrong, and it fails loudly rather than quietly.
// This project already learned that intersecting conditions collapses the
// candidate pool, and recipeSafeAcrossConditions treats "no data for this
// condition" the same as "red", so one thinly-covered condition would empty a
// menu with no visible reason.
//
// So the rule here is narrower and more useful:
//
//   EXCLUDE a meal only if it is RED for someone. Keep it if it is yellow for
//   someone, and say for whom.
//
// One dinner gets cooked. Both people see the same plan. Each person's app says
// what that meal means for THEM. A shared dinner where one person leaves out one
// component is a real outcome, not a failure, and it is what actually happens in
// a house.
//
// WHAT CROSSES THE WIRE, decided directly: CONDITION CODES.
//
// Codes only. Never a symptom, never a lab result, never a healing stage, never
// a note. A condition list is the least that can be sent and still combine two
// people's meals, and it is a thing live-in partners already know about each
// other. It is still health data, so it is its own explicit grant rather than
// riding along with the meal sharing.
//
// ONE TABLE WITH ROLES, decided directly. A person is one row in connections
// whatever they are to you, because your sister can be both a partner and
// someone you send a recipe to, and two rows would guarantee her key goes stale
// in one of them.

// The four ways one person can stand to another, written down here since
// 2026-09-22 so that everything the app does between two people reads from
// one list. lib/peerRelationships.ts says what each of them carries and
// which way it travels; this is the vocabulary those descriptions key off.
//
// Two of the four cannot be set up yet, and the app says so rather than
// offering a link it cannot finish: a child link needs the setting-up where
// a parent says what their child can reach, and a caregiver link needs the
// step where the person being cared for says yes. The talking between two
// phones is the same for all four, which is the point of naming them all
// now instead of when each one ships.
// The one import this module has, and it is safe in both directions:
// lib/peerRelationships.ts only takes TYPES from here, which are erased, so
// nothing is half-built when either of them loads.
