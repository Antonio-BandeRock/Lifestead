// Fermented Foods -- 15 entries, drawn directly from this session's own
// "Fermented Foods: A Verified Bacterial-Strain Guide" research (11
// individually-verified strains, then a second pass adding kvass/kefir/
// dosing/sourcing). This is the in-app home for the bacterial-strain
// tracking workstream CLAUDE.md's own Next Steps has flagged as a future
// research thread -- these entries ARE that research, ported in.
//
// 2026-08-07, same day, rewritten in the same narrative shape as the other
// categories already given this treatment -- every entry opens on a hook,
// develops the finding, and closes on why it matters. Every underlying
// fact and citation is unchanged from the original pass.
//
// 2026-08-08: content fields rewritten a second time to remove AI-writing
// tics flagged directly by the person -- em dashes as punctuation, "not X,
// it's Y" contrast, and overused words like "real"/"genuinely"/
// "honest(ly)"/"worth" -- see bigPicture.ts's own header comment for the
// full context. Every fact, number, and citation is unchanged.
//
// 2026-08-08, same day, third change: every entry now carries `category:
// 'basicHealth'` as part of the Digest-wide Hashimoto's/Basic Health
// restructure (see types.ts's own header comment). Every strain and ferment
// here is real, condition-agnostic microbiology -- nothing in this category
// requires Hashimoto's specifically to matter, so unlike most of this
// Digest's other mixed categories, this one didn't need any per-entry split.
//
// 2026-08-26: a 16th entry, `fermented-filtered-water`, added directly
// alongside a corpus-wide fix making every curated recipe's own water
// ingredient say "filtered water" (fermentation recipes specifically say
// "filtered, unchlorinated water"). Direct instruction: "this app

Acidophilus is probably the one probiotic name that sounds familiar, printed on yogurt cartons and supplement labels alike, often without much explanation of what it does. It's a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium found in most live-culture yogurt and many commercial probiotic blends.\n\nClinical evidence supports it for improving lactose digestion (it produces lactase during fermentation, reducing residual lactose in the finished product) and for restoring gut flora after antibiotic use. Thyroid-specific human trials of this strain alone don't exist yet. Its relevance here is as one contributor to overall gut microbial diversity, the mechanism the Gut & Microbiome research keeps returning to as the target.",

Bifidum specifically has mechanistic evidence for restoring occludin, one of the core tight-junction proteins that keeps the intestinal barrier sealed, directly relevant to the leaky-gut-repair research. Bifidobacterium counts also decline measurably with age and antibiotic exposure, both common reasons someone's baseline gut diversity might be lower than ideal.

Thermophilus is a distinct, well-characterized, food-safe species entirely unrelated to Streptococcus pyogenes or pneumoniae. It's notably efficient at breaking down lactose during fermentation, part of why traditional long-fermented yogurt is often better tolerated by lactose-sensitive people than fresh milk, a mechanistic reason behind a folk claim the Healing Stages guide already leans on.

The community fermenting sweetened tea typically includes Acetobacter species, various yeasts, and often Gluconobacter, a mixed community, distinct from the single-strain focus of most other entries here.
