// The app's one search box for a list of entries: a text field with the mic
// inside it on the hand's own side and an optional information icon pinned to
// the right. Lived inside app/(tabs)/purple-digest.tsx from 2026-08-08 until
// 1.0.40.10, when System Recipes needed the same box; moved here whole rather
// than copied, so the keyboard-lag fix below keeps having exactly one home.
//
// Why it owns its own text. 2026-08-08, the second attempt at a reported
// keyboard-lag fix and the one that found the cause: this component keeps the
// per-keystroke text itself, which is a small re-render of this component
// alone, and reports up through onDebouncedChange only once about 200ms has
// passed with no further typing. The first attempt debounced a value DERIVED
// from the owning screen's state without moving the raw state out of that
// screen, so the screen and its whole content tree still re-rendered on every
// character; only the expensive recomputation was skipped, not the much more
// expensive reconciliation of every shelf and card reading that data. The
// owning screen is now never told a keystroke happened until the debounce has
// settled. AppTextInput.tsx's own history fixed a different mechanism with
// the same "heavy owning screen blocking the next keypress" symptom.
//
// onActiveChange is a separate, non-debounced signal. It fires the instant
// this box's text crosses the empty to non-empty boundary, not on every
// character, so the caller can hide a header and snap the scroll position at
// once without having to hear about every keystroke to do it. It is optional:
// System Recipes has no header to hide and no scroll to snap, so it takes the
// debounced text and nothing else.
//
// There is deliberately no reset-on-prop-change logic here. A caller that
// wants the box cleared remounts this component through a changing `key`,
// which resets localValue for free. See searchResetKey in purple-digest.tsx.
