Transforms hashimotos_foods_combined_scored_and_nutrients_LIVE.xlsx into a
compact reference SQLite database for the Lifestead app.

Extracts: identity (food_id, source, source_code, name, short_name,
category, botanical classification), the 31 real D1-D6 six-dimension score
columns, and a curated "Phase 1 standard panel" of macro/vitamin/mineral
nutrients (see NUTRIENT_DEFINITIONS/NUTRIENT_COLUMN_ALIASES) resolved via
per-sheet column-name aliases, since the ~750 raw per-source nutrient
columns are inconsistently named across sources and not all of them are
needed by anything currently designed in the app.

Pure standard library (zipfile + xml.etree) -- no openpyxl/pandas available
in this environment. Re-runnable: drop the output file and re-run any time
the source workbook is updated.

    # corrected mid-thread: "Konjac... is kind of a cooking ingredient in
    # powder form... Konjac is not a supplement, it is a cooking ingredient
    # like baking powder would be. Baking powder would not be included in
    # supplements either. We need a different category, maybe Pantry
    # Staples: the broadest category for dry, shelf-stable ingredients that
    # are not eaten on their own." Konjac's own first move (into
    # SupplementPowder, same session) was wrong for exactly this reason --
    # its real-world role is functional (thickening/gelling), not
    # nutritional-supplement, and lumping it with Psyllium/Baobab (both
    # primarily consumed AS a supplement) missed that distinction.
    #
    # Investigating the one named example (baking powder) surfaced a much
    # bigger, real, pre-existing inconsistency worth fixing at the same
    # time, not guessed at: baking powder, cream of tartar, and baker's
    # yeast were each independently split across BOTH `Baked` (USDA/
    # Canada_CNF's own naming, "Leavening agent(s), ...") and `Herbs`
    # (Japan_MEXT/Germany_BLS/Australia_AFCD's own naming, e.g. plain
    # "Baking powder") -- the exact same real ingredient, filed
    # inconsistently depending on which of the 7 national sources measured
    # it. Gelatine/apple pectin/agar-agar showed the identical pattern,
    # scattered across `Herbs`, `Meat`, `Algae`, and `Mixed`. Every row
    # below was checked against its own full `name`, not swept in by a
    # keyword: an EATEN preparation that merely mentions one of these
    # ingredients (agar JELLY, a gelatine-set fruit CREAM, lingonberry
    # sugared WITH pectin) is a real finished food and stays exactly where
    # it was -- only the raw, add-a-small-amount-to-a-recipe ingredient
    # form moves. "Yeast, dry powder" (Australia_AFCD) and "Yeast extract
    # spread"/"Yeast flakes/nutritional yeast" are a real, deliberate split

    # never eaten alone), nutritional yeast and yeast extract spread do NOT
    # (both are real foods people eat directly, spread on toast or
    # sprinkled as a cheese-like topping, not a leavening aid).

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # 2026-08-04: the big sweep through Mixed's two giant "mostly real
    # composite dishes" buckets (Germany_BLS "Soups, Stocks & Consommes"
    # and "Prepared/Cooked Dishes", plus smaller France_Ciqual/Canada_CNF/
    # USDA/Japan_MEXT dish buckets), deferred from the earlier Australia/
    # France_Ciqual cleanup specifically because it needed real hand
    # verification at scale, not a keyword sweep. Queried all 630 Mixed
    # rows matching a sauce/dressing/gravy/vinegar/mayonnaise/mustard/
    # ketchup keyword, pre-filtered with a dish-vs-standalone heuristic
    # (dish markers: "salad", "sandwich", "pizza", "lasagna", "ravioli",
    # a cooking-verb-then-parenthetical pattern like "Boiled (with...)", or
    # a protein/vegetable/fish name as the sentence's own subject followed
    # by "with") down to 267 real candidates, then hand-read every one.
    # The dividing line, consistent with the France_Ciqual pass above:
    # a name is a STANDALONE product if the SAUCE/DRESSING ITSELF is the
    # subject ("Bearnaise sauce", "X sauce from white basic sauce", "Y
    # dressing") -- the "from white/brown basic sauce" phrasing just
    # describes the sauce's own roux base, not that it's serving a larger
    # dish. A name is a DISH (left in Mixed) if a FOOD is the subject and
    # the sauce is something added to it ("Beef Boiled (with caper
    # sauce...)", "X salad with Y dressing", any sandwich/pizza/lasagna/
    # ravioli with a sauce, "Potatoes with herb sauce..."). 143 of the 267
    # candidates were genuinely standalone; the rest (composite dishes,
    # sandwiches, dressed salads, branded frozen meals) stayed in Mixed on
    # purpose. Confirmed zero base_name collisions with any other Mixed
    # raw_category bucket before writing these overrides -- none of them
    # risk pulling in an unrelated dish from a different source.
    #
    # Deliberately NOT touched in this same pass, flagged for a possible
    # future one: the family of flavored compound butters (Basil/Herb/
    # Horseradish/Lemon/Mustard butter) sitting in this same Mixed bucket
    # -- moving just "Mustard butter" because it happened to match this
    # sweep's own keyword search would have split an otherwise-identical
    # small family inconsistently; better to review all of them together
    # later than fix one by keyword coincidence now.

    # 2026-08-04: raw-ingredient leakage cleanup inside Mixed's two giant
    # "mostly real composite dishes" buckets (Germany_BLS "Soups, Stocks &
    # Consommes" and "Prepared/Cooked Dishes"), a separate, non-sauce-
    # related issue flagged during the same day's earlier sauce sweep and
    # tackled as its own pass. Confirmed via the same regex-plus-hand-read
    # discipline: 165 candidates matching a bare protein/fish/vegetable/
    # mushroom headword with no dish-composition signal, narrowed by hand
    # to 85 genuinely bare items -- a plain cut/fillet/vegetable with at
    # most a single generic cooking verb (boiled/fried/floured/poached/
    # braised) or an explicit "without sauce"/"tossed in butter", nothing
    # that amounts to a real added recipe. Real recipes stayed in Mixed on
    # purpose: named regional styles ("Berlin style", "Polish style",
    # "Zurich style", "Baden style", "American style"), "marinated" (a
    # real flavoring, not just doneness), a real sauce/cream addition, a
    # crust/batter/dough coating, ragout/fricassee/skewer/roulade/cordon
    # bleu (inherently composite formats), "Olive" (a rolled/stuffed meat
    # preparation in this dataset's own convention, not the fruit),
    # aspic, gratinated, and compotes (a separate, not-today question).
    # Existing stock/consomme entries also stayed put, matching the
    # already-established "real soups/stocks stay in Mixed" precedent.
    # Confirmed zero base_name collisions with any other Mixed
    # raw_category bucket before writing these overrides.

    # 2026-08-04: Mushroom category cleanup, same day, direct follow-up
    # ("check the Mushroom category for the rest of that leakage too") to
    # two items flagged but not fixed during the earlier raw-ingredient-
    # leakage pass. Root cause is bigger than those two items suggested:
    # Germany_BLS's own "Starches & Potato Products" raw_category has
    # ALWAYS defaulted to "Mushroom" via RAW_CATEGORY_TO_CODE (a known,
    # disclosed imprecision from this file's own header comment -- "spans
    # Mushroom/Veg/Grain/Mixed"), so every potato/root-vegetable/starch
    # product from that one raw source label landed in Mushroom purely by
    # default, alongside the real mushroom species that make up most of
    # it. Hand-classified all 33 non-mushroom rows individually rather
    # than a keyword rule, since destinations genuinely vary: plain root
    # vegetables/potatoes with minimal prep (peeled/boiled/braised/
    # steamed, no real recipe -- the same "raw-ingredient leakage" test
    # as the earlier Mixed pass) -> Veg; plain starches (potato starch,
    # tapioca/cassava starch) -> Grain, matching "Potato Starch"/"Starch,
    # cassava starch" already there; dry instant mashed-potato powder (not
    # eaten alone until reconstituted, the same PantryStaples test as
    # potato/flour) -> PantryStaples; real prepared potato dishes
    # (croquettes, dumplings, gnocchi, rösti, stuffed potato pockets,
    # potato sticks) and cream-of-mushroom soup products -> Mixed, matching
    # the identical dish/soup precedent already established there. Every
    # genuine mushroom species (Chanterelle, Morel, Shiitake, Maitake,
    # Porcini, black truffle, etc.) stayed untouched. Confirmed zero
    # base_name collisions with any other Mushroom raw_category bucket
    # before writing these overrides.

    # 2026-08-04: new "CommercialPremade" category, explicitly requested
    # ("the Mixed Dishes should not have anything in it that is a pre
    # made dish... move them to the area we're using for things that
    # don't meet the criteria for this app"). Ties directly to this
    # session's own "home cooking over commercial/branded products"
    # decision recorded in this file's core-purpose section: the app's
    # intended path for a specific store-bought/branded product is
    # scanning it in (the still-unbuilt barcode feature), not picking a
    # generic commercial reference-database row to stand in for it.
    #
    # First pass, high-confidence only: explicit prepackaged/canned/
    # instant-mix/branded/frozen-and-refrigerated-product signals --
    # French "préemballé(e)" (prepackaged) and "appertisé" (canned/
    # tinned), "déshydratée reconstituée" (just-add-water mix), ALLCAPS
    # brand names (BANQUET, HUNGRY MAN, HOT POCKETS, LEAN POCKETS), box/
    # dry mix wording, and a hand-reviewed second tier of real product-
    # format signals ("restaurant prepared", "refrigerated, heated",
    # "frozen, heated in oven", "as purchased"). The second tier needed
    # real hand review, not a blind keyword sweep -- several "sandwich"/
    # "burger" hits in the same search (Club sandwiches, Sandwich baguette
    # variants with no préemballé marker, and several literally labeled
    # "Sandwich, ham, homemade"/"egg salad, homemade"/etc.) are genuine
    # homemade-style dish descriptions and stayed in Mixed on purpose --
    # "homemade" in a name is the opposite signal from what this category
    # is for.
    #
    # The much larger remaining bucket (~1,850 Germany_BLS "Prepared/
    # Cooked Dishes"/"Soups, Stocks & Consommes" entries with no explicit
    # commercial OR homemade marker either way) is deliberately NOT
    # touched in this pass -- there isn't reliable signal to classify
    # those by keyword or automated heuristic without real per-item
    # judgment, and the person asked to review those directly in the
    # Reference Database Audit tool instead of having them guessed at.

# Egg." Confirmed against the built database this was never missing data
# (50+ real chicken-egg rows already existed across USDA, Germany_BLS,
# Canada_CNF, Australia_AFCD and Japan_MEXT) but inconsistent, sometimes
# entirely silent, labeling:
#   - USDA's own unqualified "Egg, whole"/"Egg, white"/"Egg, yolk" rows are
#     chicken by USDA's own unstated convention -- every other species in
#     the source data names itself explicitly (Duck/Goose/Turkey/Quail) --
#     but say nothing about species at all once reordered to "Whole Egg"/
#     "White Egg"/"Egg, yolk".
#   - Canada_CNF/Australia_AFCD's own "Egg, chicken, ..." rows and
#     Japan_MEXT's "Eggs, hen, ..." rows (hen = female chicken) DO say
#     chicken already, but reorder_base_name() deliberately only reorders
#     single-comma names (see natural_name_reorder.py) -- every one of
#     these has 2+ commas, so none of them ever got the same "Duck Egg"/
#     "Goose Egg"/"Turkey Egg" treatment their non-chicken counterparts got.
#   - Germany_BLS's own rows already say "Chicken egg ..." but in sentence
#     case, one letter off this app's Title Case convention -- close enough
#     to read as a near-duplicate of whatever the fixed USDA rows end up
#     saying, rather than the exact same entry.
# Bare, no-further-qualifier forms (just "whole"/"white"/"yolk"/"poached")
# are merged onto one shared base_name across all these sources -- the same
# single-family-per-species shape Duck Egg/Goose Egg/Turkey Egg already
# have, differentiated by prep_method/source rather than by base_name text.
# Rows with a genuine extra qualifier beyond that (a specific omelet, a
# frozen/dried processing detail) keep their own comma-clause tail verbatim,
# minimally re-prefixed with "Chicken Egg," -- consistent with this whole
# module's standing rule against guessing a fuller natural-language reorder
# than what's actually known to be safe. "Chicken Egg Roll" (a USDA

# out to be silently erasing 36 USDA wine varietals and 3 branded beers
# down to "Wine Alcoholic Beverage"/"Beer Alcoholic Beverage" (see
# split_prep_method's own docstring). That's when the root mechanism
# itself got fixed instead of patching a fourth one-off case -- and the

# two real cross-source near-duplicates that only look like different foods

# different.
#   - USDA's own "purple"/"yellow" passion fruit juice rows reorder to
#     "Purple/Yellow Passion-Fruit Juice" (hyphenated) while Canada_CNF's
#     otherwise-identical rows reorder to "Purple/Yellow Passion Fruit
#     Juice" (space) -- purely a hyphen-vs-space difference in how each
#     source itself writes the word, not a real distinction. Hyphen
#     dropped to match the more common styling (also matching this
#     database's own existing "Passion fruit juice"/"Passion fruit, juice,
#     fresh" rows, neither of which hyphenates it either).
#   - USDA's "Pomegranate juice, bottled" and Canada_CNF's "Pomegranate
#     juice, ready-to-drink" are the same real thing (plain pomegranate
#     juice) described two different ways -- neither qualifier states any
#     real difference (everything in this app's Juice list is bottled/
#     drinkable in some form), so both collapse to the plain name.
#   - Three more added 2026-08-02, same day, once the person asked for the
#     Juice list itself trimmed down to one row per real fruit/variety
#     rather than several near-duplicate rows per fruit: Japan_MEXT's own

# --- Raw nutrient import (Phase 1: the "standard panel") -------------------
#
# The source workbook has ~750 raw per-source nutrient columns per sheet
# beyond the D1-D6 scores, unioned across all 7 national databases into one
# wide header row shared identically by every sheet (verified: US_Veg and
# DE_Veg headers are byte-for-byte identical). Each food's own row only
# populates the columns belonging to its own source; the rest are blank.
#
# Phase 1 imports only a hand-verified "standard panel" -- the nutrients
# that recur across most/all sources under directly comparable names and
# units (confirmed by sampling real populated rows from every source, not
# just reading header text): energy, macros, the common vitamins, and the
# common minerals, plus iodine since it's directly relevant to this app's
# own D1 Iodine scoring dimension. Deliberately excludes the much larger
# deep-detail tiers (individual amino acids, the ~150-200 column fatty-acid
# breakdown by exact chain length, sugar alcohols, organic acids, plant
# sterols, pigments, heavy-metal contaminant columns) -- those are real
# data too, just a much bigger mapping effort with more cross-source
# comparability risk (e.g. "Vitamin D (D2+D3) total" vs "25-hydroxy vitamin
# D3", a different metabolite-level measurement, are NOT interchangeable
# despite both containing "vitamin D"). Nothing about this schema forecloses
# adding those later -- food_nutrients is a normalized (food_id,
# nutrient_code, amount) table, not fixed columns, so a Phase 2 is purely
# additive: new rows in `nutrients`, no migration.
#
# A few nutrients have more than one alias column because the source
# workbook's own column-union process created near-duplicate headers
# (different capitalization/spacing) for the same measurement rather than
# merging them -- confirmed by sampling rows where both aliases are
# populated with the identical value (e.g. Australia_AFCD's avocado row has
# both "Vitamin E  (mg) (mg)" = 1.8 and "Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) (MG)"
# = 1.8). Listed in priority order; the first populated one wins.

# 2026-08-01 -- the source workbook's sheets used to be split per
# (source, category) -- "USDA_Veg", "USDA_Fruit", etc -- and category_code
# below was always just the CategoryCode half of that sheet name. At some
# point outside this project (the separate nutrition-database project's own
# workbook maintenance), the workbook was restructured into one flat sheet
# per source (confirmed directly: the real sheet names are now just "USDA",
# "UK_CoFID", "Japan_MEXT", "Germany_BLS", "Canada_CNF", "France_Ciqual",
# "Australia_AFCD" -- no category suffix on any of them). That silently
# broke every row's category_code (sheet_name.partition("_") now returns ""
# for USDA and a meaningless country-code fragment like "BLS"/"CNF" for the
# others), which cascaded into reclassify_category always falling through
# to that same empty/meaningless value -- discovered when a Cooking & Prep
# fix surfaced that ~all of USDA's own foods (this app's default,
# usdaOnly=true source) had lost their category entirely.
#
# Fix: derive category_code from each row's own `category` column instead
# (raw_category once stored -- a real per-row food-group description, e.g.
# "Vegetables and Vegetable Products", untouched by the sheet restructuring
# and still present). RAW_CATEGORY_TO_CODE below maps (source, that exact
# text) -> the category code it corresponded to historically. Built
# empirically, not guessed: extracted directly from this project's last
# known-good compiled database (before the workbook restructuring), where
# every (source, raw_category) pair's real, historically-correct category
# was already on record from back when sheet names still carried it.
# Verified this covers 100% of the (source, raw_category) pairs the current
# workbook actually contains (124 of 124) -- the `.get(..., category_code)`
# fallback below only matters if a genuinely new raw_category text shows up
# in some future workbook update.
#
# Known, disclosed imprecision: a small number of raw_category values were
# themselves heterogeneous catch-all buckets even back when sheet names
# still existed (e.g. USDA's "American Indian/Alaska Native Foods" spans
# real Meat/Fish/Veg/Fruit/Mixed rows all under one raw_category label;
# Germany_BLS's "Starches & Potato Products" spans Mushroom/Veg/Grain/Mixed;
# France_Ciqual's "Unknown" spans Baked/Grain/Sweets/Legume) -- for these,
# this mapping uses the single most common historical category as an
# approximation, which is honestly wrong for the minority of rows in that
# bucket that weren't the majority category. Affects roughly 350 of 22,016
# foods (~1.6%), and CATEGORY_OVERRIDES below still corrects any of those
# 350 that happen to already have a hand-verified entry. Revisit with
# keyword-based sub-rules (similar to CATEGORY_OVERRIDES itself) if this
# precision ever matters for a specific food someone hits in practice.

# unreachable (no subcategory value exists to select them with). This
# function assigns EVERY row landing in Meat a real subcategory -- "Fish &
# Seafood" for former-Fish rows (both paths), "Meat & Poultry" as a plain

# Real, single-ingredient Brassicaceae (cruciferous) vegetable base_names --
# 2026-08-01, added alongside the goitrogen scoring below. Raw cruciferous
# vegetables contain glucosinolates that interfere with thyroid iodine
# uptake; cooking deactivates roughly 90% of that effect (Felker, Bunch &
# Leung, "Concentrations of thiocyanate and goitrin in human plasma...",
# Nutr Rev. 2016;74(4):248-58, PMID 26946249 -- the same citation already
# written into lib/sixDimensionsReference.ts's SUB_CRITERION_SOURCES
# entry for 'Goitrogenic Load', which has sat unused until now because no
# food anywhere in this database ever actually had that score: the source
# workbook's real D1-D6 columns never included it).
#
# Built by querying every real base_name in the built database matching a
# cruciferous keyword root, then hand-reviewing all ~500 raw matches down to
# genuine single-ingredient vegetable identities. Deliberately excludes,
# each confirmed against the real `name`/prep data behind it rather than
# guessed:
#   - Composite dishes (casseroles, stews, gratins, "with X and Y") -- can't
#     attribute one ingredient's raw/cooked state to the whole dish.
#   - Condiment/processed mustard, horseradish, and wasabi products
#     (prepared mustard, mustard seed/powder, horseradish sauce/mousse,
#     wasabi paste) -- a fundamentally different food and serving context
#     from the vegetable itself, confirmed via each one's own `name` field
#     (e.g. "Mustard hot", "Mustard sweet" are the yellow condiment, not a
#     mustard-greens variety).
#   - Fermented/pickled items (sauerkraut, kimchi, and anything whose own
#     `name` says "pickled" even when base_name itself doesn't, e.g.
#     "Radish, hawaiian style" / "Cabbage, japanese style, fresh" both
#     confirmed pickled by checking their real `name` field) -- fermentation
#     alters glucosinolates differently than heat-cooking, so the
#     Raw/Cooked binary doesn't honestly apply; already covered by the
#     existing Fermentability sub-criterion instead.
#   - Mixed-vegetable blends -- can't attribute a single ingredient's state.
#   - Foods whose common name merely contains a cruciferous word but aren't
#     actually Brassicaceae, confirmed via each one's own `name` field:
#     "Prairie Turnips"/"Turnip, Prairie, native" (Pediomelum esculentum, a
#     legume) and "Swamp cabbage (skunk cabbage, water convulvolus)"

#   - Non-English (French Ciqual, most Japanese pickled variants) --
#     deferred as a known gap, same as this app's own already-disclosed
#     France_Ciqual prep_method coverage gap (those rows can't reliably get
#     a Raw/Cooked tier anyway).

# 2026-08-01 -- the source workbook's own D6 Oxalate Level/Load Rank/
# Mineral Binding Risk/Tolerance Note columns used to correctly cover

# scratch, sourced the same way the rest of this app's D1-D6 data is: real,
# cited external references.
#
# Sources (the same two this app already cites for every D6 sub-criterion,
# see SUB_CRITERION_SOURCES in lib/sixDimensionsReference.ts) -- corrected
# 2026-08-01 after a direct check found Broccoli isn't actually in the Wake
# Forest list despite an earlier version of this comment implying every
# food here was cross-checked against both:
#   - Oxalosis and Hyperoxaluria Foundation's 2024 oxalate list, fetched
#     directly both as the PDF (https://ohf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/
#     Oxalate-List-022724.pdf) and, 2026-08-01, as its own live category
#     pages (https://ohf.org/oxalate-food-content-database/ and its
#     vegetables/fruit/grain/protein/dairy/sweets/etc sub-pages -- same
#     underlying numbers as the PDF, confirmed identical, but each page
#     also shows OHF's OWN tier letter per food (L/M/H/VH), which is NOT
#     what OXALATE_LEVEL_BASE_NAMES below is built from -- their letter is
#     based on OHF's own chosen reference serving size per food (varies
#     food to food: 1/4 cup for nuts, 1 medium for fruit, etc), while this
#     app uses the "avg oxalate per 100g" column consistently across every
#     food instead, matching the per-100g convention the rest of this
#     app's D1-D6 data already uses and staying consistent regardless of
#     how much of a food someone actually logs (this app doesn't rescale
#     D6 tiers by quantity). The two bases genuinely disagree for some
#     foods (e.g. Okra: 101mg/100g here is "High" under this app's own
#     threshold below, vs. OHF's own "Moderate" letter for their smaller
#     56g reference serving) -- not an error, a deliberate, disclosed
#     choice of denominator. Every entry below was directly cross-checked
#     against these live pages' own 100g figures; one real fix came out of
#     it -- Sweet Potato was wrongly using the peeled/without-skin value
#     instead of the more standard with-skin one, see that entry's own
#     comment. ~500 foods total across both PDF and pages -- the PRIMARY
#     source for most individual entries below, including Broccoli, since
#     it covers far more real whole foods than Wake Forest's own list does.
#   - Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center Urology's own oxalate
#     food list (mg oxalate per 100g), fetched directly:
#     https://www.wakehealth.edu/-/media/wakeforest/clinical/files/urology/oxalate-food-list.pdf
#     Only ~130 foods, mostly older USDA-SR-style entries (no broccoli,
#     no almonds, no cauliflower/cabbage/kale among them) -- used here
#     specifically to CROSS-CHECK the smaller subset of foods it does
#     share with OHF, and to calibrate the tier thresholds below, not as a
#     second citation behind every individual entry. Any single food's own
#     entry below is sourced from whichever of the two lists actually
#     contains it -- usually OHF alone, occasionally both, never Wake
#     Forest alone (OHF's broader coverage means nothing here relies on
#     Wake Forest as its only source).
#
# Tiered against thresholds empirically reverse-engineered from this
# project's own last known-good database (cross-referencing real mg/100g
# values against foods that still had a correct, unregressed tier there)

def split_prep_method(name, short_name=None):
    """Extract a food's cooking/prep state from its full name.

    Returns (base_name, prep_method). Three different strategies, tried in
    order:

    1. The current source workbook's own USDA rows often give short_name
       itself a trailing "(prepstate)" parenthetical -- e.g. "Broccoli
       (boiled)" -- a deliberate, reliable convention for exactly this
       when it's present, confirmed 2026-08-01 against 3,370 real USDA
       short_names. Checked directly on short_name via
       _TRAILING_PAREN_RE/_match_prep_term above, ahead of strategy 2
       below, since it's a more direct signal than reconstructing intent
       by diffing against `name` -- and structurally distinct anyway (a
       parenthetical suffix, not a comma-separated one), so the two
       strategies don't actually compete for the same rows.

    2. Most OTHER rows' own "Short Display Name" column is a genuine
       PREFIX of the full `name`, with the cooking/prep descriptor already
       stripped off by whatever curated that column -- e.g. name=
       "Broccoli, cooked, boiled, drained, with salt", short_name=
       "Broccoli". Confirmed empirically 2026-08-01 across USDA/UK_CoFID/
       Japan_MEXT/Canada_CNF/France_Ciqual/Australia_AFCD, all of which
       had near-zero real prep_method extraction under the OLD approach
       (parsing short_name alone) for exactly this reason: the prep info
       was never IN short_name to begin with, only in whatever `name` had
       left over past that shared prefix. That's what this branch mines,
       splitting the leftover text on commas and checking each clause
       against COOKING_TERMS/RAW_TERMS/STORAGE_TERMS in priority order
       (not just the literal last word, since the leftover text is often
       several clauses long and the clause that actually matters for
       scoring isn't always the final one -- see the tier lists' own
       comment).

       When NONE of the leftover clauses match a known term, the leftover
       is kept in `name` rather than discarded -- fixed 2026-08-02 after a
       real, serious case: this branch used to unconditionally collapse to
       bare `short_name` even when nothing matched, silently destroying
       whatever the leftover actually said. Reported as "the alcohol
       brands seem to have been removed"; investigation found that was
       true (3 real branded USDA beers -- BUDWEISER, BUD LIGHT, BUDWEISER
       SELECT -- had all collapsed into one indistinguishable "Beer
       Alcoholic Beverage" alongside 5 OTHER unbranded beer variants with
       no way to tell any of them apart), but the same mechanism was doing
       far more damage than just brand names: all 36 of USDA's real wine
       varietals (Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Riesling, etc.)
       had collapsed into one "Wine Alcoholic Beverage," and all 8 of its
       distilled-spirit rows (rum/vodka/whiskey at various proofs) had
       collapsed into one "Distilled Alcoholic Beverage" -- exactly the
       kind of information a person needs to pick the right real product,
       silently gone. This was already a known, flagged risk (see this
       file's own git history / CLAUDE.md's Next Steps around this date)
       from two smaller, individually-patched cases found earlier the same
       week (a dropped "queso seco"/"cheddar or colby" cheese variety, a
       Chicken Egg species ambiguity) -- alcohol is what finally showed how
       large the blast radius of leaving this unfixed really was, so the
       mechanism itself got fixed here rather than patching a fourth
       one-off case. This branch's own worst-case fallback now matches
       strategy 3's below (which already falls back to the full,
       untruncated string when it can't confidently extract anything) --
       consistent, and no case where it can lose real information the
       old behavior didn't already risk losing.

    3. Germany_BLS is the one source where short_name already equals the
       full name (nothing separately truncated), so there's no separate
       suffix to mine -- this and any other row matching neither strategy
       above falls through to the ORIGINAL single-trailing-word check this
       function always used, completely unchanged, so that already-correct
       behavior stays exactly as it was.

# Reference Database Audit tool decisions, 2026-08-04 -- explicitly
# requested ("Let's apply those changes as they are so far... The answer
# file is located at ..."). The audit tool (a separate Claude Artifact,
# not part of the app) lets the person review this database directly --
# hide, move, or rename (AKA) any (category, subcategory, base_name)
# group -- and export those decisions as JSON. This is the FIRST real bulk
# import of that export: 10,165 decisions (8,058 hide, 2,002 move, 105
# rename-only, plus 31 rows that combine a move with a rename) spanning
# nearly every category. Applied as-is, trusting the person's own review
# rather than re-litigating individual calls -- at this scale that's the
# only sane approach, and re-second-guessing would also waste the actual
# point of building a review tool in the first place.
#
# Applied as ONE final pass over the fully-resolved `foods_rows` list,
# right before the INSERT -- deliberately NOT folded into
# CATEGORY_OVERRIDES/reclassify_category (which key off a row's raw,
# pre-resolution incoming category_code, a repeated source of real bugs
# this session whenever that distinction was missed -- see the PastaNoodles
# "boiled sibling" mistake and the Cheese Sauce dead-override mistake, both
# earlier in this file's own history). The audit tool's own decision keys
# are built from the FINAL, fully-resolved (category, subcategory,
# base_name) a person actually saw on screen -- matching against the same
# final state here, after every other rule has already run, is the only
# way to guarantee these decisions land on the rows they were actually
# made against.
#
# "hide" decisions don't touch category/subcategory/base_name at all --
# they mark a new `hidden` column (see the `foods` table's own comment)
# instead. Deliberately a real, data-driven column rather than extending
# the existing ALCOHOL_HIDDEN_BASE_NAMES-style hand-typed TS Set pattern
# in lib/db.ts to 8,000+ entries -- that pattern was fine at the 10s-100s
# scale it was built for, not this one.
#
# "move" decisions reassign category, and subcategory too when the
# decision specifies a targetSubcategory -- when it doesn't, subcategory is
# cleared (set to NULL) rather than left as whatever the OLD category's own
# subcategory rules had computed, since a subcategory label computed under
# the old category (e.g. Alcohol's "Wine & Champagne") usually doesn't mean
# anything once the row has moved to a different category entirely.
#
# "renameTo" (present with or without an action) replaces base_name only,
# matching the exact same precedent already established this session for
# SPIRIT_CLEAN_RENAMES/JUICE_CLEAN_RENAMES -- `name` (the real, full
# source-provided name) is never touched by any rename in this pipeline.

        # this app's core purpose of letting someone find their own
        # personal patterns -- see this file's own Assessment/Bio-Compass
