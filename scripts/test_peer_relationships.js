// Checks lib/peerRelationships.ts, the allowlist that says what may cross
// between two PEOPLE (2026-09-22, direct instruction: "the communication
// flow as per what is being done between the user's devices needs to be the
// same kind of process that happens between partners, and their children,
// and where applicable, their care giver").
//
// This file is the security surface of that feature, so the checks here are
// about what CANNOT happen rather than about what can:
//
//  1. No relationship carries a table this app holds somebody's health in,
//     unless it is an area where one person acts on another's behalf.
//  2. Nothing that is not ready carries a table at all, whatever the role
//     and whatever the permissions.
//  3. A permission switched off carries nothing for that area, and no
//     combination of switches lets an area through the side door.
//  4. Every column marked as staying here names something.
//  5. The four roles are all described, and the ones that cannot be set up
//     yet say what they are waiting on rather than going quiet.
//
// Run with: node scripts/test_peer_relationships.js
// Exits non-zero on any failure.
