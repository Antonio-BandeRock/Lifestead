// silently fell through to the normal, unstripped candidate-key path.
// Confirmed by direct query against the rebuilt database that all 32 of

//
// Narrowed a second time the same day, per direct correction: "I was
// thinking that the Japanese fruit juices listed would just be those that
// have a Japanese name. All others outside of those that match a USDA or
// other English entry should be used." The first version forced every
// Japan_MEXT-EXCLUSIVE row into this group, which is a different thing
// from a row actually being a distinctively Japanese fruit -- Apple,
// Grape, Grapefruit, Lemon, Lime, Passion Fruit, Pineapple, Navel Orange,
// and Valencia Orange only ended up Japan_MEXT-exclusive in THIS
// database's own source coverage, not because the fruit itself is
// Japanese; grouping them as "Japanese" read as a confusing, unexplained
// duplicate of the same common fruit name (worse once `juice` was added to
// GROUP_STOPWORDS above, since those same common names then also started
// surfacing normally, unlabeled, right alongside their "Japanese" copy).

  // Array.prototype.sort is stable in this engine, so a comparator that
