// Keep reminding me until I mark it (C2 of the competitive build plan,
// Phase 2, 2026-09-26).
//
// Until now one switch in Profile > Reminders decided, for every reminder at
// once, whether it came back: three follow-ups at 15, 45 and 90 minutes.
// Somebody who needs the morning pill repeated every ten minutes and never
// wants the bins repeated at all had to pick one answer for both. Each
// routine, each To Do List thing and each reminder somebody sets now
// carries a choice of its own:
//
//   null  follow the Profile switch (the old behaviour, and the default)
//   0     once, never again, whatever the switch says
//   N     every N minutes, whatever the switch says, because asking for it
//         on this one thing is the request
//
// A follow-up stops the moment the thing is marked, because every reminder
// that uses these is rebuilt from the record at the next reconcile and a
// marked thing has nothing left to build from. It also stops by itself
// after KEEP_REMINDING_SPAN_MINUTES, so a phone left in a drawer is not
// buzzing all afternoon about a pill from breakfast.
//
// Pure on purpose, with no expo import and no database, so
// scripts/test_keep_reminding.js can check it without a phone.
