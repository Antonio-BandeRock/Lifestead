// Reading and writing one OneDrive folder through Microsoft Graph.
//
// WHAT THIS BUYS THAT ANDROID COULD NOT. Folders. Android's document provider
// for OneDrive hands out single files and refuses to enumerate directories, so
// no picker built on it can show somebody their own folders. Graph lists them,
// which is what makes choosing a folder a real choice rather than typing a name
// and hoping both phones meant the same one.
//
// SHARED FOLDERS ARE NOT IN YOUR OWN DRIVE, and getting that wrong is the whole
// feature. A folder somebody else shared with you does not appear under
// /me/drive at all; it appears under /me/drive/sharedWithMe as a stub carrying a
// remoteItem, and the real thing lives in THEIR drive. So nothing here addresses
// items by id alone: every folder and file is a (driveId, itemId) pair, because
// an id without the drive it belongs to is not an address.
//
// EVERY REQUEST GOES THROUGH ONE FUNCTION. graphFetch attaches the token,
// refreshes it when it has aged out, and turns a Graph error body into a
// sentence rather than a status code. One place means a permission problem
// reads the same wherever it surfaces.
//
// ON A COMPUTER NONE OF THIS RUNS. The OneDrive client there already keeps
// the folder on the disk, signed in by the person once for the whole
// machine, so every exported function below hands off to
// lib/desktop/cloudFolder.ts when isDesktopApp() says so, and the folder is
// read and written like any other folder. Same DriveItemRef shape, with
// driveId 'disk' and the absolute path as the itemId, so nothing above this
// module knows the difference. A runtime check rather than a metro swap,
// because what changes is where the folder is, not which package answers.
