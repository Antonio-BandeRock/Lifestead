// What is in the kitchen right now: reading it, adding to it, using it up.
//
// 2026-09-05, asked for directly: "I shouldn't need to open the grocery list.
// It should live somewhere... The user needs a way to add to their inventory
// of on hand kitchen items, or mark them as expended, with them being able to
// quickly add the item to the list as they want to."
//
// Correct, and the gap was real. Kitchen inventory existed only as a
// read-through inside the grocery list (see kitchenCoverageFor in
// lib/groceryList.ts), computed from garden and fermentation harvests. There
// was nowhere to look at it, nothing to add to it, and no way to say something
// had run out.
//
// THREE SOURCES, ONE VIEW. Garden and fermentation harvests keep their own
// tables, deliberately: a harvest has a lifecycle a pantry item does not (a
// planting, a batch, a ready date), and folding them in here would flatten
// that away. kitchen_items is the third source, holding what someone entered
// and what a ticked grocery line put there. listKitchenInventory unions all
// three, and every one of them carries a remaining quantity in the same shape,
// so the draw-down arithmetic below never needs to know where a row came from.
//
// THE HONEST LIMIT, stated here because it is the whole risk of the feature:
// nothing comes off any of this without the person saying so. Logging a meal
// asks what it took from the kitchen (components/GardenPlateOfferHost.tsx,
// since 2026-09-27) and "I Made This" shows its plan first, but a meal never
// logged, or a "Not this time", leaves the kitchen claiming food that was
// eaten. Every row therefore carries the date it arrived, and the screen shows
// how long it has been sitting, because an amount the app cannot verify should
// at least say how old it is.
//
// Every amount taken off a kitchen_items row is also written to
// kitchen_usage_log (2026-11-13), which is what lib/kitchenLow.ts reads to say
// when a food is running low.
