// The between-people mailbox, running by itself (J12, 2026-09-29).
//
// Until now what somebody shared with a partner, child or caregiver moved
// only when one of them pressed Send or Check on the Connections screen.
// This does the same two things on its own, on the same footing as
// SnapshotSyncWatcher does between one person's two devices:
//
//   at startup and on coming back to the app  check, then send
//   about every 30 seconds while open         check
//   about 15 seconds after a change here      send
//
// NOTHING NEW CROSSES. Sending is sendViaOneDrive and checking is
// receiveViaOneDrive, the functions the two buttons call, so what goes to
// each person is still decided by lib/peerRelationships.ts and the grants on
// that link, sealed for that person, and checked on arrival the same four
// ways. The buttons stay, for somebody who wants it to go now.
//
// A SEND GOES ONLY WHEN SOMETHING IN IT CHANGED (onlyWhenChanged), since a
// merge of what arrived is a change here too, and without that two phones
// would hand the same copy to each other for ever.
//
// TWO CARRIERS SINCE M1 (1.0.62.2): the OneDrive folder and the relay at
// insidestoryapp.com, each sent to only when what it last carried changed.
// The same copy arriving by both is merged once and then to nothing. The
// relay asks Google to wake the other phone when mail lands
// (lib/pushWake.ts), so it is checked at startup, on coming back and on a
// wake-up rather than every 30 seconds, which keeps the requests a phone
// makes to it small. The desktop gets no wake-ups and checks it every few
// minutes while its window is in front instead. OneDrive not being set up no
// longer stops the relay, since the relay needs nothing set up.
//
// QUIET, like every other merge (ANNOUNCE_MERGES): what arrived is read in
// Sync Activity. Two things are never said: no folder chosen, and not
// signed in, since somebody who has not set up the mailbox is not doing
// anything wrong. A folder that was chosen and cannot be reached is said
// once a run, since failing in silence was the 1.0.42.30 bug.
