// The things that carry a date but never lived in the schedule, 2026-09-16.
//
// Direct request: reminder coverage for everything else that carries a date.
// Bills, upkeep and expiring work benefits all sit in Life, all have a date
// that matters, and until this pass none of them could reach the phone.
// Garden tasks were the fourth on that list and are not here, because they
// already are schedule_items rows (item_type 'garden', see
// scheduleGardenTask in lib/db.ts) and so travel the existing candidate path
// with nothing new needed but a kind.
//
// These three do need something new, and it is not much: each already has a
// module that works out the date from whatever it stores, and the rule this
// file follows is to call that module rather than re-derive anything.
//
//   Bills     finance_recurring keeps a due_rule_json and
//             financeSchedule's nextOccurrence turns it into the next date.
//   Upkeep    upkeep_items is LAST-DONE-anchored, not calendar-anchored
//             (see that table's own comment for why the two are genuinely
//             different), and upkeep's upkeepStanding does that arithmetic.
//   Benefits  work_benefits has reset_on, and workBenefits' benefitStanding
//             says whether there is anything left to lose when it comes.
//
// Re-deriving any of those three here would be the drift this project keeps
// having to unpick elsewhere: correct the rule in one place and the reminder
// would quietly disagree.
//
// A fourth joined 2026-09-21, the Days Until counters under garden areas
// ("Add a reminder on the day for a Days Until counter"), on the same rule:
//
//   Counters  garden_countdowns has started_on and days, and
//             countdown's countdownDueDate is the one place that adds
//             them; gardenCountdownDb's listRunningGardenCountdowns already
//             knows which are still running under an area still in use.
//
// That source stopped being only about the garden on 2026-09-22, when a
// counter could be started for anything at all (lib/countdownDb.ts). Both
// kinds raise the same reminder on the same rule; they differ only in where
// a tap lands, Garden for one and Life for the other, which is what the tab
// field on a source is for.
//
// A fifth joined 2026-09-23, a compost pile waiting to be turned:
//
//   Compost   compost_piles carries the pile's cadence and compost_events
//             carries every turn, and compost's compostTurnDueOn adds the
//             two. Before this the Compost lens booked a single garden task
//             that did not come back and did not clear when the pile was
//             actually turned; now the date is worked out from the pile
//             itself, so recording a turn moves it and nobody has to book
//             anything again.
