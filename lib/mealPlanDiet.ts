// The eating style a meal plan is built around (2026-09-27, direct
// request: "When generating my meal plan, it should also ask me which
// eating style do I use and then it creates the meals around that plan").
//
// Profile > Diet Preferences already held the answer and the generator
// already filtered by it, but the plan form never asked, so the only way
// to plan a Mediterranean week for somebody whose Profile says Paleo was
// to change Profile. This splits the one tag list (RecipeDietTag) into
// the three questions a person would answer about how they eat: what
// they eat at all, the style they follow, and anything they leave out or
// lean toward. The form starts from Profile and a change there holds for
// the plan being made, never written back.
//
// 2026-11-03, direct request: "Plan meals this way should also list the
// ethnic categories as well, such as Mexican." A cuisine is a fourth
// question and a different kind of answer. The diet tags are rules every
// dish has to keep; a cuisine is what the person would like to cook, so
// the plan leans toward it inside those rules (leanToCuisines) and fills a
// meal from every recipe where too few of that cuisine's dishes fit.
//
// Pure, with no React and no database, so scripts/test_meal_plan_diet.js
// checks it without a phone.
