// Your Story by tab, 1.0.52.3. Direct instruction, 2026-09-25: "Each of the
// Tabs should be listed and available for where they might want to get
// started with their use of the app, but the guidance needs to show when
// something else needs to be done first before they can get out of it what
// they might be looking at. If they want to see information about the foods
// they eat, there are things that need to happen so there is data to pull
// from."
//
// The newspaper sections in lib/yourStory.ts say what to set up; this says
// the same thing from where the person is standing: which tab, what it gives
// back, and the one thing that has to happen first. It reads the item views
// buildYourStory already made (view.allItems) and decides nothing about when
// an item is done, so the two can never disagree.
//
// The order of TAB_GUIDES is the recommended order and means something:
// the tabs where records go in come first (Life, Food, Garden, Schedules,
// Signals, in the menu's order since 1.0.70.1), then the tabs that give
// back what those records hold (Insights, Trends, Reports), each one naming the tab its missing record goes into.
// Any tab can still be started from; "Start here" only marks the first one
// with something to do.
//
// Pure, imports nothing at runtime but lib/yourStory.ts, and covered by
// scripts/test_your_story.js.
