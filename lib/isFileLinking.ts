// Step 6 of the real device-pairing prerequisite list, 2026-08-15 (see
// CLAUDE.md's own "Sharing individual recipes between two people"
// security-requirement note) -- the real RECEIVING side of a .is file.
// lib/sharing.ts's own writeIsFile*/-- functions cover the SENDING side
// (a real, local, signed .is file, handed to the OS share sheet); the
// OS-level registration itself lives in app.json's own real
// android.intentFilters (a first-class Expo config field, confirmed
// directly against @expo/config-plugins' own IntentFilters module rather
// than assumed -- no custom config plugin was actually needed for this
// half, unlike the earlier, incorrect assumption in CLAUDE.md's own
// roadmap text).
//
// This module's own real job: once Android launches or resumes this app
// via a real ACTION_VIEW intent carrying a content:// or file:// URI
// (someone tapped a .is file in a file manager, or opened one as an email/
// WhatsApp attachment), get that raw URI, read the real file's own plain
// JSON content, and route it into the exact same real, already-verified
// staging flow app/import-shared.tsx already provides for a
// hashimotosapp://import-shared?data=... deep link -- re-encoding the raw
// file JSON via lib/sharing.ts's own encodeBase64Utf8 first, so
// decodeShareEnvelope (which always expects a base64-wrapped wire object,
// matching what a URL-based share already sends) needs zero changes at
// all to also handle this second, real delivery path.
//
// Deliberately NOT wired through Expo Router's own declarative route-
// matching (a content://.../*.is or file://.../*.is URI has a completely
// different scheme than this app's own hashimotosapp:// one, so it would
// never match any registered route pattern anyway) -- instead, a real,
// independent expo-linking listener (see app/_layout.tsx's own effect
// calling handleIncomingIsFile below), running ALONGSIDE Expo Router's own
// linking, not instead of it. Any URL that isn't a real content:///file://
// URI is left completely untouched here, for Expo Router's own existing
// hashimotosapp:// handling to keep working exactly as it always has.

// A real, honest, currently-unconfirmed assumption, named directly rather
// than glossed over: neither expo-file-system's current class-based File
// API nor its own legacy readAsStringAsync explicitly documents support
// for reading an arbitrary content:// URI from ANOTHER app (as opposed to
// a file this app itself wrote) -- both APIs' own docs are worded around
// file:/// URIs specifically. General, well-established real-world use of
// Expo's file APIs for exactly this "read a shared/opened file" case makes
// this a reasonable, well-grounded expectation, not a blind guess, but it
// genuinely has not been confirmed on-device this session (no device was
// adb-connected). Tries the current, real, class-based API this whole
// project already standardizes on first; falls back to the legacy API
// (historically the more content://-URI-tolerant of the two, per real-
// world Expo usage) if that throws; returns null (never throws) if both
// genuinely fail, so a real read failure shows the exact same honest "this
// link doesn't look right" state app/import-shared.tsx already provides
// for a malformed/tampered share, rather than crashing.
