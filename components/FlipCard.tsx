// A small, single-concept "micro-learning" card -- a striking icon and a
// one-sentence hook up front, a bite-sized tip on the back. Meant to be
// used several at a time in a row, so a big idea (what Hashimoto's is, why
// food timing matters) is broken into pieces small enough to actually get
// read, instead of one long paragraph nobody taps into.
//
// 2026-08-23, direct report on Home's own Digest-sourced cards: "they
// don't link back to the information card in Digest where they refer to,
// and they cut off in mid sentence without baiting their appetite." Two
// real, separate problems: `backBody` cutting off with nothing signaling
// there was more, and no way to reach the full entry this card teases.
// `onReadMore` is optional so this component still works for any caller
// with nothing real to link to; every current caller passes one.
//
// 2026-09-12, direct request, three parts: "apply the same formatting to
// the Digest cards" (the band look every other Home box now carries: a
// thick accent down the left, hairlines top and bottom, no right edge, no
// corner radius), "the section of the Digest where they exist should be
// seen as a header for each card" (the `header` prop: the Digest category
// the card came from, as a header row on both faces), and "each card
// should be capable of scrolling vertically if there is more info on the
// front or back than can be displayed".
//
// THE SCROLL, and why the back face is built the way it is. Reported the
// same day, twice: "the backs don't seem able to scroll vertically." The
// history: on 2026-07-27 a vertical drag on the back moved the whole page,
// and the fix chosen was react-native-gesture-handler's ScrollView, on the
// reasoning that its handler would claim the gesture. The 2026-08-23
// "cut off in mid sentence" report and both of today's say it never did.
// Two things stood between a finger and that scroll view, and both are
// gone now rather than one at a time:
//
// 1. nestedScrollEnabled was never set. On Android a vertical scroll view
//    inside another vertical one (this face, inside Home's page) hands
//    every drag to the outer page unless it opts in. InlineSelectList and
//    KitchenSection already set it for their own nested lists; this is the
//    app's own recipe, on a plain react-native ScrollView, applied here.
// 2. The flip button used to wrap the whole face, so a JavaScript touch
//    responder sat above the native scroll view and the two negotiated
//    every drag. The back face is a plain View now: its header row and the
//    "Tap to flip back" line are the tap targets, and the scrolling body
//    sits outside any touchable at all. The front keeps the whole-face tap,
//    since tapping anywhere to turn a card over is the point of it.
