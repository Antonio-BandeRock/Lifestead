// Healing Stages -- added 2026-08-07, directly porting this app's own
// already-published research ("The Healing Stages: A Grounded, Staged Food
// Guide," an Artifact from 2026-08-05/06) into real in-app digest content,
// rather than leaving it as a standalone document nobody browsing this tab
// would ever find. CLAUDE.md's own healing-journey-stages section has
// named a decided 5-stage clinical framework (Triage -> Digging -> Gut
// Repair -> Rebalancing -> Maintenance, attributed to Dr. Izabella Wentz)
// since 2026-07-31, but until this pass, nothing in the app actually
// explained what to DO at each stage. That source document cross-mapped
// the 5 clinical stages onto a simpler, practically useful 3-tier
// structure (matching CLAUDE.md's own "only stages 2 and 3 meaningfully
// drive food decisions" scoping note): Stage 1 Getting Started (~clinical
// Triage+Digging), Stage 2 Rebuilding (~Gut Repair), Stage 3 Well-Healed
// (~Rebalancing+Maintenance). Every entry below keeps that source
// document's own upfront honesty check: the 5-stage clinical scaffold is a
// practitioner framework, not peer-reviewed consensus (already disclosed
// as such in CLAUDE.md), but the specific food lists, timelines, and
// reintroduction methodology inside each stage are drawn from real
// elimination-diet, SIBO, gut-barrier, and Hashimoto's-specific trials,
// held to the identical evidence-tier discipline as every other category
// here.
//
// 2026-08-07, same day, rewritten in the same narrative shape as the other
// categories already given this treatment -- every entry opens on a hook,
// develops the finding, and closes on why it matters. Every underlying
// fact and citation is unchanged from the original pass.
//
// 2026-08-08: content fields rewritten a second time to remove AI-writing
// tics flagged directly by the person -- em dashes as punctuation, "not X,
// it's Y" contrast, and overused words like "real"/"genuinely"/

    teaser: 'The organizing idea behind everything else in this category.',
    summary: "Five clinical stages sound thorough, right up until it's time to figure out what to actually put on a plate. Two of them are all this category needs to worry about. The already-decided 5-stage clinical framework (Triage, Digging, Gut Repair, Rebalancing, Maintenance) only really drives food decisions in two of those five stages. The rest are mostly about hormone dosing, nutrient correction, and lab monitoring.\n\nA simpler, more practically useful 3-tier structure covers the same ground for food purposes: Stage 1 \"Getting Started\" (elimination first, a short, well-reasoned list of safe foods), Stage 2 \"Rebuilding\" (systematic, one-food-at-a-time reintroduction, fermented foods enter here deliberately), and Stage 3 \"Well-Healed\" (broad, diverse eating; tracking becomes a spot-check tool rather than a daily requirement). Everything else in this category maps onto one of these three stages, worth having in mind before diving into any single entry.",
